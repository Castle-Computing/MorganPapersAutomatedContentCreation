Dear Mr. Hearst:
This is the first time I have had to trouble you regarding misunderstanding between myself and people fur-nishing materials for your work. This is in regard to the [illegible] sash O. frames for center windows of houses A B & C.
You will remember asking me to get figures on this work. The first [illegible] marked A, is the one I sub-mitted to you last August. You authorized me to go ahead and order the sash and frames not as listed, but so that double sash could be operated together or singly, the outer sash to be interchangeabley screen or glass. The time I quoted you to complete the work was between six and seven months. The [illegible] the [sash?] could not be made to do all the things requested & the [details?] come from corected & sent back many times before an entirely satisfactory solution, was finally [illegible] at, [illegible] all your conditions. The work had meantime been proceeded with on my understanding that the price would be approximately as quoted, except for the double sash & the four [illegible] [illegible] included, such as lobby of A & baths lower suite
It was a surprise to me when the agent recently brought in his contract for final signature, (Esplanade B) & I have not been able to [illegible] at a satisfactory adjustment. I the agent believe that was entirely wrong in not informing me, as that I might in turn inform you, that the"approximate price was being exceeded beyond a reasonable amount, there giving you if you desired an opportunity to cancel the order.
I believe part of the difference in expense charged is due to the fact that at the time the estimate was submitted no one representing the [illegible] had been to San Simeon, and that when the [illegible] went to take the measurements and saw the [matter?] exposer he would have to provide against, he had the [illegible] got [illegible] more expense than figured on to make the sash [illegible]. a guarantee against storm damage, is a condition of the [illegible] [proportion?] and the [proposed?] [illegible]. Under the circumstances do you think me to cancel the order or best it as [was?] [illegible], The [illegible] [illegible] the sash for C is ready for shipment, the sash for A & B [illegible] so.
The wood sash have been tried out under the most severe possible tests this winter and I can say there is no leakage through the sash. In a couple of instances water was blown in under the frames, but these leaks were caught and corrected before the decorations were set. All trim has been made & set so that in frames could be ready [illegible].
Rightly to bother you with this;
yours very T-

Dear Mr. Hearst:
This is the first time I have had to trouble you regarding misunderstandings between myself and the people furnishing materials for your work. This is in regard to the steel sashnand frames for certain windows of Houses A, B, and C.
You will remember asking me to get figures on this work. The first enclosure marked A is the one I submitted to you last August. you authorized me to go ahead and order the sash and panes, not as listed, but made so that double sash to be interchangeably screen or glass. The time quoted to complete the work was between six and seven months.
The manufacturers claimed the sash could not be made to do all the things required and the details were corrected and sent back many times before an en-tirely satisfactory solution was finally arrived at, meeting all your conditions. The work had meantime been proceeded with on my understanding that the price would be approximately as quoted, except for the double sash and the few extra windows included, such as of lower suites, lobby of A and baths.
It was a surprise to me when the agent recently brought in his contract for final signature (Enclosure B). and I have not been able to arrive at a satisfactory adjustment. I believe the agent was entirely wrong in not informing me, so that I might in turn inform you, that the "approximate price" was being exceeded beyond a reasonable amount, thus giving you an opportunity to cancel the order.
I believe part of the difference in expense charged is due to the fact that at the time the estimate was submitted no one representing the manufacturer had been to San Simeon, and that when the agent went to take the measurements and saw the weather exposer he would have to provide against, he had the manufacturers go to consid-erably more expense than figured on to make the sash water tight. A guarantee against storm damage is a con-W.R.H.-2
dition of the original proposition and the proposed content.
Under the circumstances do you wish me to cancel the order or treat it as non-existent, and fight it out? The manufacturer claims the sash for C is ready for ship-ment, the sash for A and B nearly so.
The wood sash have been tried out under the most severe possible tests this winter and I can say there is no leakage through the sash. In a couple of instances water was blown in under the frames, but these leaks were caught and corrected before decorations were set. All trim has been made and set so that iron frames could be readily substituted. 
Regretting to bother you with this,
Yours very truly,
