Dear Mr. Hearst:

The Gymnasium--Tennis building - shall it be called the Recreation Building?, complete with pools, etc., will cost about $125,000.00; the structural work alone about $65,000.00.

Will it be all right to plan to do the rough concrete and get the two courts into service, and then drop the finishing work for the time being and go back onto the Patio wings?  The enlarged foundations for the service wing work are going in now, so as to get through the torn up kitchen and pantry stage by July.

Thank you for the ease of mind occasioned by your telegram saying we may have the needed funds.

Yours duly gratefully
