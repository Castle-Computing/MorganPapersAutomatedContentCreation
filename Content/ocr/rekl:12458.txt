[Sense of telegram sent Mr. Hearst]

NOV 19 1922

DO YOU WISH ME TO EMPLOY FOR YOU A LANDSCAPE GARDENER.  SHERER ADVISES BEGIN PLANTING AT ONCE BECAUSE OF FAVORABLE CONDITION OF GROUND.  IN ANY CASE IT WILL TAKE ALL OF DECEMBER AND JANUARY TO DO THE PLANTING.  A GOOD PANORAMA PHOTOGRAPH COULD BE TAKE FROM THE 70' TOWER.
