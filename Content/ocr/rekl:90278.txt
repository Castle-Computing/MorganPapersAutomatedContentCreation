Dear Miss Morgan : 

	Replying to your letter of the 12th stating 
that you can use the mantels which are in the warehouse in New 
York if Mr. Hearst prefers them, Mr. Hearst says,-- "No. But 
they are pretty mantels to use SOMETIME and somewhere." 

Best wishes, 
Sincerely yours, 

J Willicombe

P-S I tried ts reach you 
this afternoon through your 
office and home phones to 
tell you that theVultee 
was leaving Mills Field for 
the Ranch if you cared to 
come dawn on it. JW
