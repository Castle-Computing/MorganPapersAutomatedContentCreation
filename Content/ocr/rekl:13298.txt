Mr.William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards the changes in the "little" houses --

The divided baths in House B were completed, except some painter's work, before Christmas.  They look better than I thought they would -- not so narrow.

The divided baths in House C are being tiled and will be completed before the end of January.

All the piping is complete for the new lower baths in all three houses, but no work has been done on the rooms as explained before, or on the C towers beyond having the rough plumbing ready.

The new modeled frieze, door trim, shutters and doors for the Room of the Hero Shield Ceiling, House A, are finished and at San Simeon ready to put up as soon as the camp opens.

The extra stone lintel is finished and set in the fireplace in your room and apparently completes the cure, - also is very decorative.

Mr. Miletin is making a similar piece, only to match the mantel, for the fireplace in Mrs. Hearst's room.  If yo do not approve we can make use of the lintel elsewhere as a seat panel.

By to-morrow's mail I will send plans for the new rooms of all three houses as prints could not be had today.  You will find a suggestion for making a "sitting room" of the lobby in House C.  The other plan left more storage room, but this would make an interesting guest suite.  Perhaps it would be a good place to display the armour -- either on velvet background, or gathered together more closely without such background.
Notes and questions in regard to the studies for ceilings, trims, etc. are attached directly to the drawings.

I thought you might like to use up the small scale door motifs, originally intended for the Royal Suite in the House B suite, and also like to make the new House C suite carry somewhat the feeling of the little tower rooms, using suitable beam ends from you collection, single beds like in the towers,

In House a the new baths cannot be on the level of the bed rooms but the little stairways to them might be effective.  On examination it does not seem prudent to cut out the walls sufficiently to recess the bed as agreed when you were here, but an alcove effect could be given the lower end of the room perhaps with as satisfactory results.  (The big entrance door will have the effect of making the rooms look smaller than they are).

The big Renaissance fireplace in the social room of the main building is up and, without throat, damper or anything but the natural opening as it happened to be, draws to perfection.  I think we will wit before doing anything more to it until you come.  The mantel is none too large for the room -- and is so much more beautiful than the photograph suggested, that it is a delight. It will be carefully padded and permanently boxed in until the completion of the room.  MR. Hadley made an excellent job of its erection.

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan

[Notes]

All right never mind the above effect.  Lets change the door a door with a (?) for light might be better.  Am glad its beautiful and glad that it draws these things are eye catching together or (?)
