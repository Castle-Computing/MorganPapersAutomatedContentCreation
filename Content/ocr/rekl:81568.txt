Miss Morgan:

Here is the copy of that letter that got lost somewhere between our train on the way East and your office.  Will you please expedite matters as much as you can, as Chief will be back in six weeks or so and will be disappointed if the work not completed or nearly so.  I gave him that beach-house account for okay; presume he has overlooked it and will remind him.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I asked Mr. Slattery to furnish me with a list of employees in his department. It is enclosed.  It seems very extensive.  I think it can be cut down considerably.

Mr. Keep's department does not seem to be very extravagent.  It is possible, however, that he might lay off a man.

Mr. Macklen's department is rather extravagant.  I think a couple of men more or less might be laid off;  and I think the Italian who works on the esplanade and who is doing extremely good work, should be put on a monthly salary.

Addison, I think, is also disposed to employ too many men and to buy too many animals.  He must conduct his department more economically.

The department of protection was ridiculous, but I have let one watchman out and one road patrolman.  I think we might let one gateman go.  Mooney, Baldwin and Sieverts are enough.

The road does not have to be patrolled all the time. The important time is from five till seven when the men are coming down the Hill and eager to get away.

I do not know what the utility crew does.

The household is extravagant, chiefly in the culinary department.  I hope the new cook will remedy this, and with fewer and better people.

2.  Enclosed is a bid from Mr. Frank A. Hellenthal, 728 Santa Monica Boulevard, Santa Monica.  He is a very reliable contractor.  The bid is for work on a trunk-room addition at the beach-house. The important part about it is the third paragraph, which states that one of the main piers of the house is resting on an old cement slab which shows signs of cracking and which will cause a settlement of that part of the house.

Of course this is a true statement of the facts, and this at least must be corrected and a proper foundation provided as promptly as possible.

The house has settled in one or two other places, notably in the East wing, and Mr. Flannery admits that one of the piles was apparently not driven deep enough and has settled an inch or two.

We had an engineer visit the house twice, one provided by the Herald, I think, and he stated that settling was not important, and there was no need of doing anything unless it got worse.  Mr. Flannery is a good draftsman but is not a very experienced architect, and is nothing of an engineer.

Miss Morgan--2.

Carpenter Brothers, the contractors who built the house, are involved in various difficulties.

It is possible that the foundations were not as good as they should be, and I would rather remedy any defects now than wait until the defects become more serious.

I suggest that Hellenthal be given the work he has agreed to do, and that he furthermore proceed to remedy thoroughly the defect in the foundation that he has noticed, and finally that he go very thoroughly over all the foundations of the house and find what is necessary to be done in order to make them as prefect as possible.

It may be necessary to drive some more piles, but I do not see how this can be done now that the house has been built.  It is possible, however, that concrete piers could be put in.

Will you kindly have Hellenthal and Flannery before you and see what can be done in these matters?

---------------

3.  The second letter of Hellenthal contains a bid for certain additions to the house, including an elevator and a library extension.

I would not ordinarily go ahead with this construction at this time, but it occurs to me that it is possible that this construction might be made in a way to increase the strength of the foundations.

If so, I would be willing to do this while we are taking other measures to improve the foundations.

I am perfectly willing to do the work on a cost-plus basis with Hellenthal.  He is a very thorough and very reliable contractor.

Sincerely,

ENCLOSURES:

Letters July 7 and 9 from Hellenthan to Flannery; also letter form William S. Corcoran July 10 and one from G.M. Holstein, Jr., July 9 to Flannery; also Slattery list of employes.
