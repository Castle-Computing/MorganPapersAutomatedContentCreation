November 3, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Miss Worn coming back, wanted to know if you had decided as to what should go on the 
white walls either side the main Neptune pavement respectively toward "C" Terrace and 
toward "B" Terrace -- the walls where planting of blue plumbago was started.  Geranium
 and lantana?  She will plan for the mixed cannas in the beds above.

Yours very truly,
