Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your letter in regard to the loss of the emu and of the animals recently, came as a surprise and is keenly regretted.  Mr. Slattery may be making the mistake of paying in the wrong way for pleasant relationships.  In any case, I will be more watchful until you return.

To avoid friction, there seems to be need of a ruling from you as regards the possession and use of cars.  Messrs. Rossi, Acton, Slattery, Williams, Macklen and Ryan, all have personally owned family cars for Sunday and holiday use.  The situation is not what it was five or more years ago when cars were provided Keep, Webb and Rossi as a necessity, in order to keep their families content at San Simeon.  Under the present conditions it would seem as though cars need to be provided for working purposes only, for construction, farm, and warehouse activities.

For the household, the case is different as no one of the 'household', except Mr. Acton, has a personally owned car.  In any case, will you kindly 'rule' as to the custody of household cars, and as to whether their use is a Slattery activity, on which he is to exercise his best judgement?

I am sending up one of our own office 'flivvers' for the use of our young men, so that they will not need to be considered.  (You will be providing the gas and oil and replacing tires, if needed).

A word directly from you will stop a friction I see developing.

Yours very truly,
