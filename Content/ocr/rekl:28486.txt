Dear Miss Morgan:

Answering yours of the 12th, the repairing of the rugs is all right if the people are capable of doing it.

2.  I do not think it is worth while to use old material on chairs.  I think wherever there are repairs to be made it would be better to put on new and strong material, not only in the cases mentioned, but in the case of many other chairs that are wearing out.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
