In answer to your telegram I think it would be better
if you would not come down until the end of next week, when you
will have practically all the plans that we need. '

Deer Miss Morgan:

I don't know where to locate the bunk house. I em
only sure of one thing, that I don't want it where it is. ,I
think that whole section where the house is should be graded
and laid out in grounds for the house and whatever immediately
belongs to the house.

i I think we should have the approach from the bay as
we have planned it and I think we should have the out-buildings
where they will not only not be objectionable, but will be
interesting in the landscape proposed. ‘

When you come down we will have to decide whether we
want the ranch establishment and farm house together or whether
we want them separate, us we had formerly thought.

. I think Parks is so much more amenable than Lee that
we 6011' have to take intoconeideretion the difficulties that
we woul. have had with Lee, and possibly we can put the Whole
institution into one rather imposing community.
