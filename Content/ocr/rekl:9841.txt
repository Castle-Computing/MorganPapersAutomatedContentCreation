Dear Er. Hegrst:

i, The attached drawings are rather .
massed, as they have been much worked over.

It is evidently necessary. as you
891d, to keen the margin of the arch finely
reticulated. Sould you make tn; aoffit of
the arch, as well n9~the edging, of‘caat
atone? Or Just the edges with a tile soffit?

‘ It has taken many studies to come
this near t0 a Solution, as the scale must

be large. to show from below. and small,
to big with the frieze tile.

Yaurs very truly,

Qiotated.but not re-read.v
