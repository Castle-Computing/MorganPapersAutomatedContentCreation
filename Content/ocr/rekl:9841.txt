February 16, 1922.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
The attached drawings are rather mussed, as they have been much worked over.
It is evidently necessary, as you said, to keep the margin of the arch finely reticulated. Would you make the soffit of the arch, as well as the edging, of cast stone? Or just the edges with a tile soffit?
It has taken many studies to come this near to a solution, as the scale must be large, to show from below, and small, to tie with the frieze tile.
Yours very truly,
Dictated but not re-read.
