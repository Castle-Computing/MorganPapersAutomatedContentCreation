Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is a letter which may interest you from a Mrs. Sanderson who goes to China buying for collectors and for a small shop of her own in Berkeley once or twice a year.  I have enjoyed seeing her things, because not the usual kind.  Asked her this trip to get me snap shots of picturesque courtyards, small houses, gardens, etc. and to see what architectural elements could be had, -- but not to get anything but the information.

She doe snot say whether the "lantern" walls and little roof cresting figures are old or not.  

I have a start made as a first suggestion for Chinese Hill.  It may be too formal, but the informal layout had a Japanese suggestion as a plan. 

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
