Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr Hearst:

Farm Group

When at the ranch last Tuesday I went over the Castro House region and followed up the creek beds to the more or less level spots which are so plainly in view from the houses.

Mr. Clark's chief objection to this site for the farm is the present lack of water but once the dam is built across the arroyo an ample water supply will be assured.

Mr. Clark also thinks the ground, except in the fertile spots in the little swells, is too rocky and poor for your purposes, while on the other hand cutting the continuity of the general ranch range.  He will write you regarding the location proposed further on.

Architecturally the buildings in this position would be set on a little eminence almost surrounded by a ring of natural verdure, and would make a very pretty spot in the foreground.  Mr. Clark thinks this spot is nearly two miles in from the sea although it does not look to be that much from the hill.

I still have the set of farm building drawings made just after you left last year, for the site selected on the hill beyond the cow barn.  I did not send them to you because, while meeting all the housing needs, and "decorative", the layout seemed not very practical from the point of view of paddocks, cow walks, enclosures, etc.  - all very steep or requiring much levelling of ground, as I had to use up all the level space for the building group itself.
Mr. Clark promises to provide some idea of the numbers of animals in the various herds to be accommodated, and then I will make you some tentative sketches with those figures as a basis for sizes of the various units.  Evidently it will take quite a little study to co-relate all the elements entering.

Very truly yours,
JM:G
