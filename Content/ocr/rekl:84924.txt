December 30, 1931.
Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, California.
Dear Miss Morgan:
I will not order red and yellow damask from French & Company. In fact I will not order anything we really do not need these days.
2. I am glad the garden is in such good condition. I was afraid the cold had done much harm. Perhaps the coldest weather is now over.
3. I shall have much pleasure in locating the two fine camelia trees.
Where do you think they should go?
It seems from this distance that they might go on the north and south side of the plaza in front of the big house.
4. We should keep Mr. Williams working on the furniture.
5. I suppose Mr. Keep is getting ready to plant rather heavily towards spring.
6. I hardly think we can afford Mr. Adams this year. Perhaps things will be better next year.
7. I would like to concentrate whatever work we do on finishing indoors.
Sincerely,
