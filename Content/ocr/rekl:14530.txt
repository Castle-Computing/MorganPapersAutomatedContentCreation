Sunday, March 1, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In my letter of February 26th I omitted to list the extra check for $10,000.00 (acknowledged February 2nd), which you allowed us last fall to help on certain accounts (marble and plumbing).  This is case the report was not clear.

Friday at San Simeon, the day was fine and the grounds showed no damage from the wind and storm the night of your last visit.

The surveyor has plenty to do getting grades long needed and has ready for you ten road layouts.

Yours very truly,
