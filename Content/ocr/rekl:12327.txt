Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

                                          Miscellaneous Points

1.  Would it be possible to get some idea of the depths and construction of the Main Building Living Room ceiling?  If we could place the hangers, etc., for its support while we are constructing the room it would save a lot of extra work.  Also could we have dimensions of the set of four arches proposed to use in the end of the Breakfast Room under the Venetian motif?  We cannot get these dimensions from the photographs with enough accuracy.

2.   The photographs of the little windows you have bought for the Refectory much delighted me.  They are exactly what is needed.

3.  Are we to have more choir stalls to match the fine set on the Hill?  The reason I ask is because, if not, it would probably be better not to recess the walls.

4.  did Mrs. hearst speak to you of the possibility of using the big Italian mantels now in Bed Rooms of Lower A for the ends of the Breakfast Room?  Taking down the della Robbia plaques has made much difference in the appearance of the rooms, so that while the mantels are perhaps over large, they no longer seem so out of key.

5.  In regard to the covering for Mrs. Hearst's white and gold set -- samples of embroidery a, and the silk obtainable here, were mailed before your letter was received.  I hope they reached you all right.

6.  Mrs. Hearst agreed that the color of
the brocade for the B sitting room set was just right, but she did not like the design. --I feel sure the plain old gold is best for the room.  If you could find a better design in even approximately that color, it could be re-dipped here to match exactly as the sample sent you was "treated"

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
