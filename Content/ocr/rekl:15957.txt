Dear Mr. Hearst:

Would you like me to substitute for you and Òspend the dayÓ asked, seeing chicken plants?

Every fancier has his own idea as to details --but I do not wonder at Mr. HammondÕs criticism of the San Simeon ÒplantÓ in its present form.

Yours very truly,

P.S. I kept a copy of the letter.

Mr. W.R. Hearst,
Los Angeles, Calif.

Dear Sir;

After visiting San Simeon and the Poultry last Sunday, I have come to the following conclusions.

The climate and soil conditions are fine for poultry, and the place you have picked out is fine, but you must construct a poultry house with shutters or blinds on account of fogs if you wish success.

The young stock is doing fine considering the housing and feed conditions.  I told Mr. Parks and the Lady that I would send up some feed, and I gave her instructions how to feet etc.

There is know use to send up a man until we can construct some kind of housing for young stock, for it must be separated.  and do not construct same until I or some one checks the plans etc. or in other words you have around seventeen varities, and an American breed cannot be housed or feed like a Leghorn etc.

The Incubator house for instance wants to be cut back in hill to hold an even temperature, brooder house must be made special, you are breeding show birds and not in the utility game for eggs. Breeding is an art and it took me six years to breed R.I.Reds that won up and down this Coast.

If you can spend one day with me I can show you some plants that are wonderful, that will last a life time, or better still if I can get your ideas, I will draw up the plans needed and send up my own men to build same under my instruction, and when it is done you will have a plant that is right, saving you money and on the way to success.

This will give you eighteen years of my experience in the Poultry game, and last year I handled over ten thousand specimens with the Shows, so I believe I can give you advice that you could not obtain elsewhere.

So if you want an up to date plant, spend a day with me, give me an idea what you want to put into same, and in a couple of years time you will have all ribbons and Cups needed to decorate a room, I am at your service  me hear from you.

Very Truly Yours

E.I. Hammond
