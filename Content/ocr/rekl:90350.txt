Mr. W. R. Hearst 
McCloud, Calif. 

Dear Mr. Haarst: 

	Interest in the Bridge Henge problem made me forget 
to take up the subject of San Simeon refrigeration - 

	The present plant was bought 18 years ago - and first
located in a shed by the Chinamen's cook tent-. It was an 
early patent machine made by the General Electric Co., and
has run with a minimum of repairs these years. 

	It now needs a complete overhauling of its compressor
and a general renewal of its metal ice containers - The
members of the film who handled it here are all dead, and
to send the heavy dumbbell to New York for repairs and
refilling will take time. -

	We had the chief engineer at the Palace Hotel who
has handled this machine go down and make a careful
inspection. He says that his tests show its is at only 40% of
its capacity, and that the results will be steadily less 
good. 

	Newer types taking less room make it unlikely that 
this machine will be handled here again. 

	As I understand a section for meat curing is 
wanted with arrangements such as installed at the Beach 
House last years, - it looks as though it would be better 
to not spend more in rehabilitating this outfit than just
enough to keep it going until you wish to put in an 
entirely new plant on that order. The existing boxes and 
piping will not need more than a general clean up. 

	As always, Yours truly, 
	
	Julia Morgan
