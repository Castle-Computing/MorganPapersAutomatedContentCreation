Dear Mr. Rossi:

The slate floor similar to one in your New York residence was duly ordered and left the quarry March 31st.

When you referred to it, it was in connection with the Library Hall (or Lobby) floor.  Did I misunderstand -- and did you mean it to be laid in the Gothic Lobby?  As far as size goes, it will fit either floor.  If it was intended for the Gothic Lobby, what be used in the Library Lobby, -- the travertine?

Yours very truly,
