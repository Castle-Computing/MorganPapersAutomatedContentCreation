Miss Julia Morgan
San Simeon

Dear Miss Morgan:

george thinks that to do the road work Mr.Hearst asked for, and to have four rooms 
finished within the next three months, we would need a budget of $15,000.00

If the elevator is to be finished up right away, and if the steam heating plant is to 
be start, he thinks nothing short of our regular $25,000.00 budget would make any 
headway.

He figures that the rooms will cost a total of $10,000.00 apiece.

We always have to remember, and as George pointed out, that four to five thousand 
dollars minimum comes out of the budget as fixed operating charges, leaving only 
about $10,000.00 to work with if we get $15,000.00.

Sincerely,
LeF:F
