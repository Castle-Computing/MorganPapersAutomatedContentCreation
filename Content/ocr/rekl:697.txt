Mr. Reilly,
C/O Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Reilly:

You asked me to let you know how the cases arrived.  So far there has been no damage; but on unrolling the large frieze I found that it had been rolled as though it were an oil painting instead of a frieze and the creases in the canvas have made the tempora come off along the creases.  For so fine a piece, it would seem to me to have deserved a more careful packing with something between the painting and the back of the canvas as the sand and grit from the original wall on the back of the canvas has done more or less damage.

Please do not magnify the damage as I do not know what shape the canvas was in when purchased.

On the whole it was a wonderfully finely packed and shipped carload.

Yours truly,
