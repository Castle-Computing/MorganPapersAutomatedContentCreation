Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As telegraphed yesterday, I was at San Luis Obispo when you car was opened up, and stayed at San Simeon to see the contents of the boxes that came over in the first caravan, opening, as you suggested, only those information as to which was immediately needed.  I will go back the last of the week and finish.  In view of the many possible uses and the difficulty of making enough drawings to show them, I believe it would be better to have the interior ready for you when you arrive here, and the boards in the office clear so that final drawings can be quickly made for you.

It was necessary to provide board, lodging and transportation in order to get men in any of the trades, crafts, or even plain labor.  The cost of temporary shacks, tents, bedding, kitchen and dining outfits etc. has been heavy, but these are an asset, as is also the rock crusher, concrete mixer, saw and other apparatus.  The camp is run on somewhat less than a dollar a day per man, which is good record as there are no complaints as to food.  The chef says he is the most important man on the mountain and while one does not like to hear it too often, the latest cook is a find.

As to wages, I have had to have Mr. Washburn run the work on a straight union basis as otherwise we could not have made even the headway made.  This has caused some trouble locally, for which I am sorry.  Most of the men are employed at union city wage plus board lodging and transportation, with the promise to Mr.Washburn and his foremen that if they would stay as long as wanted and push the work to the quickest possible end,  you would make their wage from the time of your telegram to completion, equal to $15.00 and $12.00 per day.  Housesmiths, brick foremen, modelers, tile setter foremen and such receive this as union wage anyway.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst - #2

I tried to let part of the work by contract but could get no bids.  Finally I bought for you and shipped in all the material for plumbers, electric work, roof tile and bath tile, and made contracts for putting it in place.  In a number of cases have "bought" the same material several times over because firms could not deliver.

We lost a number of good men this week who were offered $15.00 per day in San Francisco and all expenses.  I told one, Mr. Van Der Loo's best cast plasterer and stone model maker ( three of his men deserted) we would equal the pay if they would stay two weeks longer .  He said that they "just could not stand the country any longer".

For plastering, floor tile and marble setting, you provide the material and labor and pay the contractor 15% of the cost.  It was the best we could arrange.

The cement available has proved to be very slow setting and this has complicated and put back work as the walls could not be stripped when planned, and the material was needed to make other forms.  The slow setting is partly due to the lack of water to keep it soaked.

There are about sixty men in camp, and their needs, with the amount required for "cureing" the cast stone, supplying the mixer and "wetting down" has overtaxed the water supply.

Your suggestion for making loggias under the extension to Houses B and C arrived after the walls were poured.  It will be as easy to do as you may desire in regard to these later, as now.  It seems rather odd to have the rather important doorways go into rough under space.  One other change came too late to entirely cover without setting back the work badly on account of lozzia of house C where the floor had been poured for the original room and entails a seat in the loggia under the view window. It is quite happy, or would have telegraphed you.

Yours very truly,
