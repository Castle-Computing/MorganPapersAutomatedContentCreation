Mr. William Randolph Hearst
Wyntoon
McCloud, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	Enclosed are lists of special segregated 
groups of articles (collection) which we complied in
December 1937 at the request of Mr. Hagelberg.

	The times marked in red are assigned
to American Newspapers. This covers all of the articles
assigned to American Newspapers at San Simeon, San 
Francisco warehouse and museums. 

	The Early American articles at Wyntoon
and the Shasta warehouse assigned to American Newspapers
are not shown here, they being on a separate list which 
will be forwarded to you tomorrow with the Wyntoon
Pictorial Inventory.

	Very truly yours,
