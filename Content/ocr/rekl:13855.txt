Dear Miss Morgan:

I think the garden has advanced far enough now for its arrangement to be merely a matter of personal taste.  Therefore, unless you advise otherwise, I will give instructions personally to Mr. Webb about the garden -- as to the character of plants to be used and as to the arrangement of them.

-------

2.  I would like not to have any more plants ordered until further notice, as we have a great many plants here already, and trees too, planted too closely; and I think we will have enough for new gardens by a simple process of thinning out what we have and transplanting shrubs and trees to the new spaces.

I think we have too many flowers that need water, and gardeners, and consequently too much waste of money and precious water in that direction.  Therefore, I will be content with fewer flowers and will give instructions to Mr.Webb to that effect.

I am telling you this so that no one will be disposed to give Mr. Webb instructions to the contrary.

-------

3.  Will you kindly convey this information to Mr. Joy, so that when he comes down he will not give contrary orders to Mr. Webb -- and also to Mr. Daley -- but as a matter of fact I would rather Mr. Daley did not come at all because I do not find myself in agreement with him a nd his program.  If we need any landscape gardener I would rather have the man from Los Angeles, but I do not think we need anyone.

The architectural part is done by you in a very delightful way, and the filling in of the flower is, as I say, merely a matter of personal taste.

--------

4.  Regarding the arrangement of furniture in the small houses -- I think we have that pretty satisfactory now, and I would like not to have it changed.  Will you kindly instruct Mr. Joy to that effect also.

Sincerely
s/WR Hearst
