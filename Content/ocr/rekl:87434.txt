My dear Miss Morgan:

I am delighted to hear from you and delighted to know that you are improving.

Add a little Christian Science to the efforts of the surgeons and I am sure everything 
will be perfect.

I know how you feel about the necessity of doing something.  Unfortunately I felt the 
same way.

The most important thing to do however is to get yourself into perfect condition.

Do not worry.  Occupy yourself with anything that keeps you quiet, - jig-saw puzzles 
or something of that kind.

Furthermore there is not architecting on the Hill.  We are lazily fixing up the two 
unfinished duplexes.

I personally am down in Los Angeles, thinking of pictures and not of buildings.

You can take a good month or more to rest up.  In a month or six weeks, we will be 
through the picture, and I hope to be back on the Hill then.

We can thereupon plan the new Great Hall, etcetera, etcetera.

Marion joins me in sincerest good wishes.

Very truly yours,

s/ WR Hearst
