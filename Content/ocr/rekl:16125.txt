Dear Mr. Hearst:

The enclosed Linen paneling seems just right in character for the walls of sitting room of the Gothic Suite and is practically enough -- Mr. Joy laid it out.

The fountain inclosed could be very easily made here if you wished it reproduced.

As to bells:  The quotations you marked in the book are interesting if you do not think too long for good decorative effect.  It might be a good scheme to have long inscriptions on the eight bells of the large octave, each different, or one for all, and the twenty-five smaller bells with no inscription but the same general markings.

If we were old timers the bells could each bear the small figure of a different saint on the bowl, with his or her attribute treated decoratively as a banding, and omit the usual decorative lettering.

As for bell wires, conduits for the bench control for the bells, will go across between the beams of the Library Hall, this hall ceiling is being held up for the present.  (There is plenty to do.)

Yours very truly,
