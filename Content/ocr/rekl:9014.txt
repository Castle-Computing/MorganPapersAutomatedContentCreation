Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
317 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your letter en route covering the planting will be very helpful.  I am having  a copy made for Mr. Hazzard's benefit.

There were, as usual, several things did forget to speak of:

(1). The teak flooring for the big rooms of the main house; -- the hardwood people will not keep this for us longer without payment being made them.  Will this be all right?

(2).  The "furring down" of the mantel in house "B" will be much more prominent than that in the mantel of house "C", because, as agreed, it will come to the bottom of the brackets, making it almost equal in depth to the main lintel of the mantel.  In a number of recent magazines I have noticed efforts to correct troubles similar to ours, and have ben struck by the way any and all of them destroy dignity.

Standing in contemplation at the other end of the room Sunday, my eye caught by the way the fires had already blackened the back of the fireplace and it occurred to that perhaps a dull finished piece of black marble, perhaps carved also, might blend into the background and not be noticeable.

(3).  Yesterday, at Petaluma, the house of the Geo. P. Mc Nears who live on top of an exposed hill above the lagoons, was simply riotous with blossoming bougainvilliers.  They have heavy frosts there and the vines are heavily frostbitten every winter.  Mrs. McNear says the secret is to not trim as usual in the Fall., but all old material on the 
vines as protection until Spring.  Before this was done they lost their plants each winter.  It may be good hint for us.

Sincerely yours,
