This 18.8‘fiaanaial latter .-

' As you instructed. I made.the work schedule
133% winter and spring fit our budgat and was running
avonly with it. when your instructions to do aartain’
daixnite things made it evidently impossible to keep

.to it. For instance..1n putting a? the plumbing for

. ﬁh3.alalatar baths and the main building kitchen at
wan neaaaaary to practically pipe and sever the whola

mainyhniading; alao in putting in-tha frames and athJ

it-waa cheaper, and as the building has ta be analoaeﬂ
by fall a necessary a ta contract for all ﬁhe Baah.

" framae and 31338 a3 well as thaae naeaad for cloiater

gnoma: «p alaa bought the pipe line material on a
contraet by direat aarlaad ahipment\frum tha anat. u»
-alaoiﬁheflarge,areaa of marble floor. the power line
dapaatt, tha aaa$raota for tile‘for the/sixteen bathe.
eta.’eta.4 It is a big building to cover. . v

} I figured out how these contracts and.billa
- aonla be handled. and told Mr. Clark who was gaing I
GVerﬁaxpenses with as at ﬁhe time, to tall my. Bogart
that we baa told you we would have to hQVe funaa to
.mset ﬁhaae bills as Qua, and coula out down aharply
afﬁarwards so the total far the.yaar would not axaead
th© budget mm ané‘tola Mr. Clark that the sums needed
~woulﬁ be $25,000 extra for June and July, $25;000 ax“
tra for ﬁuguat and Septamber, ana $35,000 extra for
Octobar and ﬁovember. . '

, Mr. Bogart aayavtoday'we are not to have
this arrangamant. and I write new instead of waiting
till the next trip up,as money will be naﬁded next
Wﬁeko ,

I told Hr. £0331 t0.cut hia pay tall as much
as possible to keep the work running and to submit it
