Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon, California.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
This is a financial letter --
As you instructed, I made the work schedule last winter and spring fit our budget and was running evenly with it, when your instructions to do certain definite things made it evidently impossible to keep to it. For instance, in putting in the plumbing for the cloister baths and the main building kitchen it was necessary to practically pipe and sewer the whole main building; also in putting in the frames and sash, it was cheaper, and as the building has to be enclosed by fall - necessary - to contract for all the sash, frames and glass as well as those needed for cloister rooms; -- also bought the pipe line material on a contract by direct carload shipment from the east, -- also the large areas of marble floor, the power line deposit, the contracts for tile for the sixteen baths, etc. etc. It is a big building to cover.
I figured out how these contracts and bills could be handled, and told Mr. Clark who was going over expenses with me at this time, to tell Mr. Bogart that we had told you we would have to have funds to meet these bills as due, and could cut down sharply afterwards so the total for the year would not exceed the budget -- and told Mr. Clark that the sums needed would be $25,000 extra for June and July, $25,000 ex-tra for August and September, and $25,000 extra for October and November.
Mr. Bogart says today we are not to have this arrangement, and I write now instead of waiting till the next trip up, as money will bee needed next week. I told Mr. Rossi to cut his pay roll as much as possible to keep the work running and to submit it to you before letting other than temporary men go.
Sincerely yours,
