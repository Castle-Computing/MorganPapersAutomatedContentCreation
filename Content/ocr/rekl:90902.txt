Dear Miss Morgan:
		
	I have 
looked over your little
book and found some
other doors that are not
quite as elaborate and
therefore perhaps better
suited as a garage
treatment.

	On page 375 you had a 
mark. That is good 
in some respect. It isspacious and the balcony
above gives a pretty
effect. The window 
frame is most interesting
but that could easily
be improved - perhaps
after the window on 
296.

The most interesting
door to me is page 292
That is very quaint
and it is rather 
and
would to be the 
I think we mightwiden the door a lot
and still retain all 
moisture above the door.
There us no window
treatment with this 
but perhaps we could
make a window 
treatment out of the
door and coverdoor
in place 356. If we 
could I think this 
combination would be 
very pleasant and effective. 
Then the tower couldbe made a little different
and either carry a top
railing as in plate 98
or plate 222 or else
terminate with interesting
[?] and [?]
as in plate 260.

Shall we make the
tower three storie or
two. The [?] treatment
would be better for a three 
story tower. The second
for a two story tower
However do whatever
you think best 
Sincerely
WR Hearst
