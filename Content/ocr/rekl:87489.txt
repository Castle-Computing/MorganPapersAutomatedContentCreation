Mr. William Randolph Hearst
c/o Los Angeles Examlner
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I will make a real search
for your Tavernier picture, mate to the one
in the vault at San Simeon. I do not remembr
having seen it.

Will also send the samples
of tile used in the Wyntoon pool to Sir Charles
Allom, with a full section sample of the terra
gutter- and a layout for a 150 ft. by 50 ft.
pool, on the order of the Beach House for depth
and with circulation data.

As always,

Yours truly,

JM:F
