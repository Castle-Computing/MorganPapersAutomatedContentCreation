[Letter]

(Letterhead: New York American)

October 20th, 1926.

Dear Miss Morgan,

Here is some Algerian stuff which shows a very liberal use of tile.  We might want to use something of this kind, not in the new houses we plan, but in the Persian garden or something of that kind.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
