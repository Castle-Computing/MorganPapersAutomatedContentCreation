August 1, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I deposited your check for Mr. Byne and sent him a check for the same amount with request to pick up the nicest architectural material he could find -- a fine ceiling preferred, but doorways, sash and trim, etc. as opportunity offers.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
