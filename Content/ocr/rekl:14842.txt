Dear Mr. Hearst:

We have on the Hill some ready cut chicken runs and houses sent form the east a long time ago, - but arriving after the chickens had been temporarily housed.  They could be erected further up the canyon out of the way of the new construction and be extended with materials from the present runs until the new houses are ready.  We are at work on drawings -- it will take ten days to get them ready for contract bids.  I had the working drawings and specifications ready to go out for contract bids for the men's quarters, not the chicken house plans, as at that time, you will remember, it seemed the advisable order.

Yours very truly,

s/ Julia Morgan

I have just received a new interesting Italian book and had one mailed to you at the Ambassador Hotel.
