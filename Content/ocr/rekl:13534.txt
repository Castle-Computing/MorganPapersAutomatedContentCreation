MY FAMILY EXPRESSES MUCH DISSATISFACTION WITH NEW BATHROOMS DECLARE THEY ARE NARROW DARK AND UNCOMFORTABLE THINK THEY SPOIL HOUSES A.B.C.I. SUPPOSE THEREFORE WE MUST CONSTRUCT BATHROOMS AS FORMERLY PROPOSED THIS IS EASY WITH HOUSE B. BUT DIFFICULT WITH C. PLEASE SENT DRAWINGS AGAIN SHOWING POSSIBILITIES I TELEGRAPH THIS NOW BECAUSE THIS NEW CONSTRUCTION MAY BE IMPROVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE LOWER SUITES YOU ARE NOW MAKING KINDLY ANSWER BY TELEGRAPH AND FOLLOW WITH LETTERS AND SKETCHES.
