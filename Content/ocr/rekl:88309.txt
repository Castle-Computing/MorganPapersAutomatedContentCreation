Dear Mr. Hearst:

I did understand perfectly the abrupt shutdown must have been a necessity. 
 The two weeks given had to be put into trying to have things in shape for the
 winter, rather than really progressing much, the program having been carefully
 laid as agreed upon when you left.

It has left the various places as follows:

At
WYNTOON:

The frame, including roofs, and the concrete stair of the  Bridge Room is up 
and looks just right.  It is not entirely sheathed in but in good shape for 
the winter.

Â The Tea House, also in this condition, also just right.

The enlargement of the Chalet completed, 90% of the exterior complete, and 
about 60% of the interior done.  

The Turrets is practically complete, a few last carvings not having arrived 
there in time to place.  The Swiss glass inner sash to be set in lead we had 
under way, but is being held.  The German stoves are all up - and work. 


All the houses, fountains, etc. are left in winter clothes.

Mr. Pogany has completed the frescoes on the Bear House, also those on the front
 of the Cinderella House, and is coming down today or tomorrow with the last of 
 his staff - leaving the sides of the Cinderella House all laid in and partly 
 colored, but it is too cold to work longer, and the daylight for his purpose 
too short.

I was up there last week.  There has been practically no rain, and yet 
the water form the hose forms long icicles even in mid-day.  Otherwise 
explained, it is a very cold, dry Fall.  Mr. McClenahan's work I stopped 
with the rest.  All his planting is in fine shape.

At JOLON, we did not stop, as Mr. Murray had advanced the money.  It was 
less expensive there to have a few just right men work along, than to put 
in a larger crew; - it could be ready any time, - will be this way by the 
end of the month.  The rooms and baths are very pleasant and bright.  The 
furniture is over there - no bedding.

At SAN SIMEON, we were caught rather badly as the program was to do the 
outside work in the good weather and then come in and finish the bed rooms.

The new baths and dressing room section between the theater wing towers 
is poured and these roofs have been made tight; the elevator installed, but 
only with the work platform for "cab".

The changes in the upper basin of the Neptune fountain have been made, and 
much finish is in all the lower esplanade, its steps, etc. - a great deal 
of work, really.

At the BEACH HOUSE, the roofs, etc. have been thoroughly repaired - (cross my
 fingers, ) but believe no buckets will be required.

The Service Annex is completed - (no furniture).

The last painters' work is being done in the two upper "Porch" rooms.  They 
are quite different, on from the other, but both are good.  The library's 
woodwork and ceiling are completed, but there is quite a bit of work yet - 
floors to lay, painters, etc. It is as fine as the studies promised.


I happened to have been at all the places within a week, so this report is 
up to date.

All the places are in very good condition,

If you are not to be here very soon, I will have to write regarding 
your wishes on upkeep, the tapestry people, George Loorz and outside work, etc.

As Always,
Yours truly,
JM:F
