(Letterhead:  Los Angeles Examiner, Broadway at Eleventh, Metropolitan 4000)

September 21, 1927.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Referring to your letter of the 19th, Miss Head bought the linenfold panelling about which you cabled her.

I am asking Mr. McGregor to send this to San Simeon as soon as it is received in New York.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
