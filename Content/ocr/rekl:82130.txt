Dear Miss Morgan:

Through error letter was sent to you without enclosure which began "Enclosed is a list 
of books belonging to my mother which are stored.  I do not like to have books stored. 
 They go to pieces.  I think we should arrange in some way to have library shelves at 
 San Simeon for these books.
	
"I cannot make any intelligent recommendation for the moment, but I wish you would 
kindly bear this in mind and let us try to get these books out of storage as soon as 
possible."
	
"Perhaps the best plan would be to make spacious book-cases in the new Gothic room 
that we intend to make by raising the roof of the main building."

You will find that enclosure enclosed herewith.

Sincerely,

s/ H Baldwin
