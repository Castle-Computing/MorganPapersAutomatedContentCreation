Dear Miss Morgan:

The orange pots are not big enough 

We will have to have larger ones made by the potters -- which may be very expensive
 -- or we can make some ourselves in the following manner

Get Mr. Loorzto cast some in not too heavy concrete and then panel them with old tile.

I think these might be pretty swanky and they would be practical for the large orange 
trees

What do you think

Sincerely

s/ WR Hearst
