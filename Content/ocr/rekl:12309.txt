Dear Miss Morgan:

I merely wanted to suggest the possibility of making the farm plan after the Mexican model with the two Patios.  Perhaps that would not be the right thing at all--it might be stiff and also might not be suitable to the typography--the lay of the land.  I prefer to leave the arrangement to you, also how much of it we should have on the hill and how much below at the ranch-house.

I think, however, that what we have on the hill we should keep together more or less, because it is easier managed that way by the man or the family we will have in charge of the farm.

I had thought of putting the horses up near the house and the cows and chickens down on the orchard hill; but this will, I think, be inadvisable--not economic.

I do not think there is enough room on the corral hill near the house to take horses, cows and chickens, etc., Therefore I suppose the only alternative is the orchard hill, for everything of that kind.

There is one other place which might be considered and that it further down the road at the clump of tress above the big trough, what we might call the halfway trough.

The top of that hill is flat, with quite an acreage.  The road swings around the hill quite prettily and we might have the farm building there; the question to be decided would be whether it is an advantage to have the farm buildings in the midst of the orchard, or whether they would be better separated from it.  Let me know what you think and send me some little hasty diagrams, if you please.

Sincerely,
W.R. Hearst
