Dear Miss Morgan:
	There
are a few additional
suggestions for the
Stables. 
	The dining room is long
and low wit the lighting
from each end. It occurs 
to me that we might have 
a stained glass alone
or some sot of a raised
ornamental [?] light over
the central part where
the court used to be 
	This would give central 
lighting and it would
also give life and dignity
to the room
2. I think the [?]
off the living room. I doubt
whether they should also
open off the dining room.
	It deprives them of all 
seclusion. It makes them
a part of the dining room
and there are lines where
the table is being cleared
or set when this freedom
would be disturbing.
	I think the [?] would
better be closed all together 
on the dining room side. 
If not that, there should
at least be folding doors
