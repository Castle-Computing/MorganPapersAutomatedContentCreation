Dear Miss Morgan:
	There
are a few additional
suggestions for the
Stables. 
	The dining room is long
and low wit the lighting
from each end. It occurs 
to me that we might have 
a stained glass alone
or some sot of a raised
ornamental [?] light over
the central part where
the court used to be 
	This would give central 
lighting and it would
also give life and dignity
to the room
2. I think the [?]
off the living room. I doubt
whether they should also
open off the dining room.
	It deprives them of all 
seclusion. It makes them
a part of the dining room
and there are lines where
the table is being cleared
or set when this freedom
would be disturbing.
	I think the [?] would
better be closed all together 
on the dining room side. 
If not that, there should
at least be folding doors3. I think corner cupboards (whiches) would look well in the four corners of the dining room - and these could be used for China and in a decorative way.
4. How shall we treat the dining room. Shall we paint it white like the beach house or light green or what?
5. The living room could be done in plain pine like the library at the beach house. The alcoves in the [illegible]. I suggest this because our dining room furniture is [illegible] - but then our living room furniture is modern
We could decorate in all pine charmingly [harmony?] with the modern stuff if you thought best. Perhaps it is best
6. I do think one by fire place in the living room would be fine - adding greatly to the cosiness and cheerfulness of the room. 
7 In the library alcove I think we should have some book cases on the south on dining room side also. Make it a book room
Now regarding the dormitories. The suggestions5
for the Angel cottage is completed and I like it greatly. I hope these will be some way of bringing it into scale with the other houses or of bringing the other houses into scale with it.
I think the river house could be rebuilt sometime correspond with the Angel house - making both [twelve?] bed room houses - fourteen rooms altogether including the parlors.
2. The sketch for the Williams cottage is completed too. This is only a five bed room house whith one living room and one by sport room below
That house will make fine quarters for noisy bachelors - out of hearing.
We are making the roof low like the present river house so as to hide it among the trees.
3. Instead of having carved images of St Michel and of St Hubert with the dear St Nicholas with the christ child wading? the McCloud river or ofSt Ursula with her virgins or of St Anthony with his temptations and why not have large scenes of these interesting [incidents?] painted on the fronts of the several cottages.
I think this would be very decorative and attractive
The difficulty is to get the artists. Can we get them in San Francisco or must we take exiles from Germany
I have got some more modern furniture. I think that is the style in which to furnish the cottages. 
That style of thing seems to harmonize with the kind of architecture we are doing

Hurrah. I have just the right artist. Henry Clive. He is extremely clever and [busted?] I will start him to work as soon as I get your OK. How are we going to decorate the pinacles?????Another P.S.
In the matter of scale we cant very well change the [garage?] cottage. That is now as high as the proposed angel cottage and it cant be made longer on account of the trees.
But we might do something with the Pinnacles. - It has two no. I looked it up in the dictionary - We might make it wider - the Pinnacles, not the dictionary.
Or we might make it higher - or both. We could make it more outstanding some way and that might solve the scale problem.
The Pinnacles should sort of dominate. It is that kind of architecture - used for city halls and churches and such
I guess that is the solution. Let's emphasize the Pinnacles a bit - add still another M. I wouldnt considerthe breakfast cottage and the housekeepers cottage.
Those could be altered to suit or rebuilt entirely to make them fit in the picture.
However if you think the Angel Cottage is still too big please [allie?] it in such away as you think best and let me know.
Sincerely WR Hearst
Starting on the back page and sort of writing backwards to the front page is the only English [affectation?] I have and I am very proud of it.
I learned it at St Donal's from a left handed secretary
It's very convenient for the writer and very unconvenient for the reader so I generally finish with each letter on explanatory [illegible] or an apology. Herewith is the apology.
