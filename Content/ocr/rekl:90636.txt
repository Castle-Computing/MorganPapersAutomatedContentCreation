Dear Mr.Hearst:

In December, Mr.Murray asked that we provide as soon as convenient a breakdown of 
the total expenditures at San Simeon, covering the years 1919 to 1942, inclusive, 
for use by your New York office, the total according to the cancelled (audited) 
vouchers they hold being $4, 717,000.00

Even with our pre-war office staff it would be a long and difficult job to do this 
exactly, but after making a few accurate checks of costs for such items as "Water", 
"San Simeon Village," etc., it would seem that the enclosed general "breakdown" 
would be fairly close to actual cost, even though an insurance adjuster might not 
allow the costs of evolution to enter, as our records do.

If you would prefer some other form of statement, or not into these subdivisions, 
the change can be made fairly promptly.

As always,

Yours truly,
JM:F
