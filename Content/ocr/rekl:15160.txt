Dear Miss Morgan:

I bought these lions and they are so very, very fine that we must get them in some very conspicuous place.

Perhaps they can be made an important part of the east entrance as long as we are trying to elaborate that facade.

I think we have enough on the west facade and they would almost be lost there, but they surely can be made a feature of the east facade in some way.

Another point is, what will they support?  They ought to have some definite function.

Sincerely yours,

W.R. Hearst
