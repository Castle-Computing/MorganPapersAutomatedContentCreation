TO WRH 

KINCAID WAS SLOW STARTING DUE TO CAUSES  EXPLAINED BY LETTER BUT NOW EXCAVATION IS WELL UNDER WAY USING AS MANY MEN AS ARE PRESENT TRUCKS AND ONE FROM HACIENDA WILL PERMIT.  TO GO MASTER MEANS GETTING MORE TRUCKS AND LESS ECONOMY.  WHAT DO YOU THINK.  THE TRIMS FOR ALL BEDROOMS ARE DOWN AND BEING PLACED.  SITTING ROOM A IS DEVELOPING INTO FINE ROOM  MARBLE BALUSTRADE COMPLETED ALSO PATHS ON PLAZA GARDEN CONCRETE FOR MOTIFS BELOW B.  THIS WORK HAS ONLY SMALL CREW AS AGREED.  KINCAID TRUE GOOD, GARDEN IN VIEW AND GARDEN IS LOVELY DESPITE PRESENT CONDITIONS.  DEER RAIDED ORCHARDS BUT     (?)  THEY FINISHED ARE HEADING OUT AGAIN.  KINCAID DID NOT WANT WASHBURN TO GO AS HE HAD DIFFICULTY GETTING MEN.  BUT AM GOING HIS VACATION TO SEE HOW IT WORKS.  MR KINCAID SAYS HE HAS BEEN VERY FAITHFUL
