Dear Mr. Hearst:

The Celestial storm sash are ordered.  I went up Monday night - at the height of the 
storm, & investigated, - and am not sure they will be as successful as elsewhere - 
due to the whole condition being an adaptation.

If they are not successful, we will have to take drastic steps next summer.  It was not
a case of forgetting.

As always,

Yours truly,
