Mr. William Randoplh Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.
Dear Mr. Hearst,
Yesterday at San Luis Obispo it pored all day, -- it was good weather when I started. I spent some of the time writing out things that have come from our experiences on the Hill that may suggest something to you, however the new work will be managed. 
O.K.
I. That building material, labor and camp equipment bills should be paid by whoever buys -- or orders -- according to local building practice, for the various departments. For three reasons -
Why not have a certain amount of money [illegible] every week and all expenses regulated that [illegible] [illegible] [illegible]
OK
1. If only a certain sum is available at a given time, the money can be judicially distributed so as to appease the people whose supplies we most need.
OK
2. The small $1 to $200 bills can be quickly eliminat-ed and the much time lost answering telephone, letter and collector duns on these small amounts be done away with.
OK
3. As it had been, the buyer has no idea whether bills have been paid or not, and orders from a firm we owe getting poor service in return where a hurry order could be placed with a firm whose account is clear.
Dont understand this
4. It would save much time in adjusting accounts where payments are made "on account" on certificates at the Examiner office -- as we have no receipts of such payments and a-mounts are difficult to identify.
I dont agree with this
II. That all the men continually employed on the Hill be put on the Hill pay roll, whether painters, gardeners, or what not -
I think [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] [illegible]
1. Because the superintendent should be the one to say where and on what each set of men should work for the good progress of the job as a whole. Where percentages are due men furnishing or directing labor the amount of the pay roll or by superintendent. This will eliminate the constant threat to "appeal" which had had a disturbing effect.
2. The gardeners, Mr. Gillespie, etc. were put on month-ly salaries payable directly from the Examiner office, because they work different hours and on less pay (by custom estab-

lished) than the day laborers and any craftsmen. The present combination gives no trouble, -- is working harmoniously and for the first time with genuine co-operation and good feeling on all sides, but it has not always been so. and if Webb goes for lack of housing, and with a new superintendent, it may not work again. 
Until the farm unit exists they should be on the hill payroll even though it be necessary to pay them equally with the other men.
It would also, as in Gillespie's case, take the decision of whether to work or not work his gang on semi bad days, holidays, etc. away from anyone but the superintendent.
I have never communicated with Mr. Tompkins since he has [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] present [portion?] I dont [think?] a lot he is [illegible] not doing right he [illegible] [illegible] do right
[illegible] [illegible] [illegible] think we [illegible] and [illegible] [illegible]
III. That anyone employed in Mr. Tompkins' capacity be not allowed to view his personal opinions, likes and dislikes publicly and privately to the camp, as being your opinions, orders, criticisms, likes and dislikes, etc. -- as it has a very detrimental effect on the camp - the men cannot discriminate, and the effect is demoralizing. A workman told me he does twice as much work for half the pay of a former employee by the Owner's Voice, so to speak, naturally acts so as to have to be replaced, and while it may be amusing the no let up of it increases the superintendent's difficulties unnecessarily. 
IV. A detached report on the work could be made each month by the superintendent and a copy sent to you, to the architect and to the contractor. Anyone of whom could check it up if not satisfied- as to its accuracy.
What sumn is required
V. In regard to expenses - 
It is impossible to keep within any sum set, balancing labor, material and incidentals to a nicety - or - to stock up materials regardless of costs and only regarding time -- making labor take up any shortage, only it is necessary to know the program, in order to arrange economically -- because sudden spurts are expensive. 
The architect [illegible] out and the [illegible] [illegible] [illegible] in the right percentage.
VI. That the architect be paid each month the agreed per-centage on the expenditure of the month in order not to be worried for the means to carry on the work.
These are all details in a sense, but on account of their coming from a long period of experiences might simply new relationships and start work off on a clearer basis.
Yours very truly,
JM-deM

Regarding IV. A report on the work after it is done is [illegible] and [illegible] but I [moved?] [rather?] [illegible] complete and detailed [illegible] and [illegible] before the work is done
