Dear Miss Morgan:-

Herewith you will please find a copy of Mr. Hearst's instructions on the road.

Under separate cover I am mailing you another photo of the construction taken from the reservoir.

Very truly your.

Dear Mr. Tomkins;

For the new road I would like to have a perfectly even grade at as low a percentage as is compatible with the contour of the district.

1.  I think the road leading to the south of Chinese Hill can be graded better by swinging the road farther to the south where it passes the clump of trees with the stone steps, and thus getting a longer road to the crossing west of Chinese Hill.

I mean by this that if the road starts farther south from the trees it will take in several of the contours a little lower than at present, which will give it a longer run to make and consequently enable the grade to be of a lower angle and more even than it is at present.

Miss Morgan will remember that we discussed how the road should go in front of the trees, if this south road can have a lower and more even grade, it will be possible to use it for the ascending road and the one north of Chinese Hill for the descending road.  This would be better, as it is more natural to turn to the right.

From the cross roads down to the gate descending the road first ascends for a while, and then descends to the gate.  I think this grade could be made more even and probably the grade could be evened all the way down to the big knoll about a quarter of a mile to the south of the gate.  I mean the knoll above the trough.

From the top of this knoll down to the trough is one of the worst points in the road on account of the steepness and the turns.  I think the road could be made to swing out south of the present road and go below the clump of trees that it now goes through.  This would bring it lower on the big turn and we might in this way get a better grade down to the trough.

From the trough down surveys have been made which seem to solve the situation and give us a good grade.  I mean the survey that carries the road off to the east on a long loop then brings it back to the present road I hope at a low enough level to avoid some of the steep places that now exist between this point and the lower gate.

There is a bad turn just before we reach the lower gate which should be straightened out and the lower gate can be placed anywhere that will help to do this.

After you pass the lower gate the road runs along very well until we get towards the ranch house, where it takes a steep dip.  This of course could be prevented by starting the dip farther north.

2.  I would like to have an estimate on the cost of making a road from the road crossing west of Chinese Hill, this new road to run north of the orchard hill and all around it north and west, meeting the present road at a flat point on the south of orchard hill where the very old road joins it on the way up.

I think the gate now north of this point should be transferred to this point, because it is a flat straightaway point and it is easier in such a location to handle the automobiles while opening the gate.

I should a survey for the continuation of the road might be made down to the west of the present road, following in a general way the lines of the very old road, but of course making the road much longer and the grade easy.

This road would join the present road at the trough and would give two roads, one for the descent to the right and the other for the ascent.

3.  When these roads are made I think they should be paved with crushed rock to give a firm surface and avoid the trouble we now have in winter time.

4.  I would like the culverts places where they will empty into the ravines that already exist instead of as they are now, where they cut great gashes in the soil during the rains and destroy the appearance as well as the value of the land.  A good on the inside of the road would enable us to locate our culverts where we want them.

In making the roads consideration should be taken of the disposition of automobiles to swing out at curves and at curves of that kind the road should be inclined in towards the inner side enough to offset this.

Sincerely,
