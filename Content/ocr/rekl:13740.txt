Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The lines and grades of the esplanade are finally established, and follow as nearly as possible your sketch on the blue print.  It has been a real problem to get all around, miss all the roots and branches and not feel the fact that there are very considerable differences in grade.  I have had real pleasure watching the vista open up -- wish your architectural self could have had it.

The swimming pool is plastered on the inside and the pavement around it will be poured in the next few days, allowing at least the concrete mixers and trucks to move out of this area.

Mr. Neptune and the two ladies can be placed, but the finished basins will take some time yet.

All the work you ask especially for is under way and some way or other there will be commissary and bed rooms ready.  If the ceiling for cloisters are not her light canvas could be stretched and colored for the summer.  Would this meet your approval.  You can judge better perhaps whether you wanted to have all the ceilings vaulted or all wood.  As I walk down the gallery, it seems to me it would give a pleasanter impression if all of one type.

Men are working on the light and power line, the route for which, as Mr. Clark telegraphed, has been carefully considered.
The ground do not show the water shortage -- in fact have been beautiful all spring -- only with practically no wild flowers.  I have had to go up with extra frequency the last two months on account of the nature of the present stage of the work.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
