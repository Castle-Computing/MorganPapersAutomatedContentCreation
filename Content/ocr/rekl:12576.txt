January 17th, 1923.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have your letter of January 10th, and I think the list of 30 men will be all right to keep at work if they really work and are able to accomplish anything during thee winter months.  I am also anxious to keep Mr. Vander Loo for the reasons previously written you.  I think we should make adequate preparations for hurrying the work to completion after we begin work again.

I think, therefore, manufactured stuff such as Mr. Vander Loo provides should be made ready during these winter months quite as much as raw materials should be accumulated and stored.  In other words, when we begin again in March or April I would like to have enough stuff ready ahead so we can proceed without interruption.

Therefore, retain Mr. Vander Loo and anyone who may be engaged in preparing what I call manufactured material.  Will you please also have all designs made sufficiently far ahead and in detail so that Mr. Joy or any other agent of yours may not have to make designs on the moment and on the spot with the chance of their being disapproved by you later or being constructed, demolished later.

If these designs are made sufficiently far ahead I can have a look at them and the probability of changes will be still further reduced.

In other words, adequate preparation sufficiently far ahead will eliminate many of the troubles and expenses that we have had.  Therefore, I am not objecting to any expense which goes to the making of these adequate preparations.  I consider such expenses economies.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
