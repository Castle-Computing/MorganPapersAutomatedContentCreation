THIS IS A COPY; ORIGINAL LEFT AT MGM STUDIO FOR DELIVERY TO MISS MORGAN WHO WAS 
EXPECTED THERE BY MR. HELLENTHAL SATURDAY.

Feb. 16, 1934.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have just returned from the ranch.  Things are progressing slowly but sufficiently.

I had a few suggestions to make to Mr. Loorz.

I think the bear pits ought to be divided.  We have spoke of this before.  They are 
unnecessarily large and by divisions down the middle, perpendicular to the road, we 
could make four pits out of two.

I think by arching each one of the four pits at the back we could make them look 
right, and at the same time provide a little cage space or close space between the 
arches. The divisional could be iron bars or a concrete wall.

I suppose the concrete wall would look best, but I am not sure that it would would.  
What do you think?

The difference in cost would not be great.   In fact the whole proposition is 
inexpensive, and Mr. Loorz thinks that by letting it out we could have it done 
cheaply and without interference with our other construction.

Sincerely yours,

W R HEARST

Miss Julia Morgan,
Los Angeles --
