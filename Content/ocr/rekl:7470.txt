Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst instructs me to return the enclosed sketch-- FOUNTAIN IN  THE GARDEN OF THE ALCAZAR, SEVILLE-- regarding which he has made a  notation on your letter.  

I am sending you the letter that you will get clearly Mr. Hearst's  viewpoint on this and other matters discussed therein.  

Will you kindly return the letter for my file at your convenience and oblige,  

Sincerely yours,
s/ J Willicombe
