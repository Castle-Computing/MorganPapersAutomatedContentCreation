Dear Miss Morgan:

I am glad we are going ahead so strongly on the Hill.

2.  Of course the Plaza Major can wait for its pavement.

I hope the additions to the terrace in front of the main house can be paved.

In regard to the furnishing of the pool bath houses I imagine we would better have tables of wood, especially as according to our conversation they are to be corner tables and must be made to fit.

I think over these corner tables at the proper height we should have corner cabinets and that the corner cabinets should be sufficiently large and have a face-mirror on the door.

The tall mirror or cheval glass should be on the side against the wall and occupy as little room as possible.

The little corner table should have a drawer, and one plain enameled chair should be the only other furniture in the room.

We can have hooks on the wall for hanging the clothes.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
