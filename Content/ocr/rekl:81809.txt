December 7, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

There is no one available I would risk recommending for the retouching of your 
"primitives".  There is a painter who retouches for the Spreckeles Museum, but he 
is in Europe at present.  Another man who might do, is engaged for sometime ahead.

Yours very truly,
