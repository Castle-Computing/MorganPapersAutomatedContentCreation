Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst has notified Mr. Richard A. Clark, 410 Hearst Building, San Francisco, that 
he approves the plan submitted by Mr. Clark of having the handling of insurance on his 
(Mr. Hearst's) personal articles on the Pacific Coast, center in that office.

It will be appreciated, therefore, if you will have correspondence with Mr. Clark on 
these matters.  For our records, it might be desirable to send a carbon copy of such 
correspondence to Mr. Hearst at the Hotel Ambassador.

Your  careful attention and cooperation will be appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

J Willicombe

Secretary to W.R. Hearst
