WILL BE AT SAN SIMEON MONDAY WOULD LIKE SEE PERGOLA STUDIES THINK PERGOLA TOO FAR 
DOWN HILL STOP IT SHOULD START FROM CREST OF LITTLE KNOLL TO WEST OF WHERE IT BEGINS 
AND KEEP CONTOUR LEVEL ALL WAY AROUND TO PERSIAN HILL AND BEYOND TO AXIS OF LONG 
STAIRWAY THIS LEVEL HIGHER UP WILL BE MUCH EASIER AND CHEAPER TO CONSTRUCT AND WILL 
ALSO MZKE BETTER JOB I THINK PERGOLA AT PRESENT LEVEL WOULD BE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR ME 
TO UNDERTAKE AT UPPER LEVEL PERGOLA WILL BE EASIER TO REACH BOTH FROM WEST END AND 
FROM PERSIAN HILL=

W R HEARST.
