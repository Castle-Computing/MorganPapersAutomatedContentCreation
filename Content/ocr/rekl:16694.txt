My dear Mr. Rossi:

We are all leaving the hill.  We are drowned, blown and frozen out. The trouble is not merely with the weather.  It is with the houses.

In the various rooms of the small houses the weather strips wail like a chorus of lost souls, the windows leak little rivers of running water and under the doors the droughts blow like thin hurricanes until the rugs flop on the floor.

Everybody has a cold.  All who could have left and the few who remain are eagerly waiting a chance to get out.

I have explained that the houses aren't really finished yet, but it seems strange that houses which have been built for three years aren't yet ready for occupancy.  Of course the houses are wonderful to look at but one cannot live on looks alone.  Living in them is like living in a palatial barn 

No matter how good looking any house is it is valueless if it isn't practical, - if it isn't of use.   If we are to live in these houses we must make them fit to live in.  Before we built anything more lets make what we have built practical, comfortable and beautiful.  If we cant do that we might as well change the names of the hoses to pnuemonia house, diphtheria house and influenza bungalow.  The main house we can call the clinic.  I am not coming back to the hill until we put the small houses at least on a livable basis.  You have a pretty complete list of the things which ought to be done if you will only  do them.

1	Improve the fireplaces and chimneys.
2	Get in the larger wires and heaters.
3	Make the windows twice as heavy.
4	Put in dove tail weather strips.
5	Put sills on windows and doors.
6	Put weather strips on doors if droughty.
7	Get more light plugs and lighting fixtures.
8	Get more hot water - a boiler to two baths.
9	Waterproof the concrete where needed.
10	All the things which we have found necessary to redo on the small houses 	lets do on the big house to begin with.

In putting in the telephones lets provide for a telephone in every lobby.  That means three for House A, three for House B, - when altered, two for House C. 

In the big house five lobbies and in the new houses to be built at least three each.  Of course there will be other connections, but every lobby should have its telephone for convenience.

W.R.H.
