Letterhead:  Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, 
California

April 3, 1930.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I find the enclosed ceilings.  I imagine they belong to us in which case you want 
the diagrams.

If they do not belong to us there are some here that we should have.

I have lost track of our ceilings.

Perhaps we should try to make a book of them as we have of various other decorative 
features.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
