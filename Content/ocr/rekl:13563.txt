Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Rossi gave me your message last fall in regard to providing all metal cases and fittings for the pantries and kitchens.

I have taken up the kitchen and pantry plans in detail with the best people here in these lines, and have on the accompanying sheet the general plan you approved, as modified by the detail gathered from these expert sources.

A good deal of time has been spent in making sure of the most up-to-date equipment.  The fuel used would be distillate, burned with a small rotary burner.

The main changes are:

1.  Having but on pair of service doors between the small and main pantries.

2.  Turning the ranges toward the service hot and cold table instead of having them at right angles to it.

3.  Making ample provision in the small pantry for service when only a few are to be served.

4.  Making more complete and exact the outfitting of the pantry service.

5.  Introducing a little hot water and steam boiler in the corner of the basement below the kitchen to take care of all the sinks, hot tables, etc.  This will be less expensive to run and keep in order than any of the electric devices, and the burner will not be heard in this location.
Enclosed with this letter are various metal samples.  The finest installation would be if you used the Monel Metal which is rust proof for all time.  The next best would be the American Steel, and the least best, the planished ordinary steel.

The table tops would be Monel Metal in any case,m so it is chiefly a question of case material.  The cupboard would have trays instead of shelves to draw out-with arrangements for keeping each set of dishes segregated, and providing individual compartments for cups, glasses, etc. in the trays, thus allowing no piling up of dishes.  Spaces for higher articles would be made by omitting intermediate trays.

If you will let me know your wishes, I will have the work started at once.

Yours verytruly,
JM:G

Monel Metal would cost one third as much as American Steel and double the cost of ordinary steel.
