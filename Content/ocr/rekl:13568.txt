Mr. W.R. Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive, 
New York City, N.Y.
It will be practical to get the swimming pool, esplanade and kitchen wing in usable form and houses B and A complete and furnished by middle of July with pipe line to reservoir and some work on Main building that will require more men than at present. What would you think of dropping all work on House B until late fall. It is doubtful if it could be usable and would keep garden torn up too late to make good again this season.
