September 15, 1923.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your enclosure from the Midland Counties Public Service Corporation regarding the electric service with your notation is received.  I have asked MR. Rossi to get Mr Kelley over once more to re-figure the proposition on a basis of coming to San Simeon only and installing the transformer, etc. and meters there.  Also to see if a fairer arrangement cannot be had on the refunding.

Enclosed is a water report on actual conditions this, the worst, month.  As Mr. Rossi had to stay by the construction work I had the plumber, Mr. Rankin, go up the line.  He is not an engineer, but has installed many private water systems, so I knew we would get sensible data.

As soon as the concrete is poured to the steel level the two men will go down and get the water flow in the Arroya Seco bed, and also levels so as to be able to show in one of the panoramic photographs where the lake would come to were the dam built below at the heights and as outlined in your letter.

Yours very truly,
JM 
GRC
