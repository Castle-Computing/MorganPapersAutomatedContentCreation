Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you sincerely for your very kind and helpful letter.  It is indeed good to know 
that you have been successful in your own "come back" and I'll pattern on your sketch 
as far as possible.

What happened to me was, that not healing, the innermost ear chamber became re-infected 
and the miserable sequence of operations all had to be gone through with again.

It looks now as though the healing would be perfect, and I'll be good as ever soon.

As always,

Yours truly,
