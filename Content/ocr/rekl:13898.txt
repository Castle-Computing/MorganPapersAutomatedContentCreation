August 13, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon,
California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your check for Mr. Byne I duly forwarded, with instructions as per my letter to you of August first.  It seems that the bank sent the check by air mail and that it was burned up according to the enclosed account and they wish you to send me a duplicate.  If you will kindly do this it will much oblige

Yours truly,

JM-deM
