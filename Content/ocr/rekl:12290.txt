Dear Miss Morgan:

I imagine what I wrote in regard to the matter of the lobbies for the library is sufficiently plain, but nevertheless I am returning the two drawings which illustrate the idea I have in mind.  I discarded drawing A and would like to substitute drawing B for the stairs and the lobbies.  The two lobbies, however, to be connected not by a linen closet but by a corridor similar to that shown in the center of drawing C.  There will still be room for closets back of the fire-place and in other nooks.  The two large lobbies connected by the corridor should be impressive architecture.

Sincerely,
s/W.R.Hearst
