March 15, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As a result of a talk with Mr. Parks yesterday, we agreed to try a new combination.  Mr. Parks does not want to worry over following drawings, but wants some solution to his real labor problems which I understand.  He suggested that his men do the work, if Mr. Rossi would lay out the duck pond, etc. for him and stop off from time to time and see that his (Mr. ParkÕs ) men understood and followed the plans.  Also that we provide the materials other than the sand and gravel, if this suits you.

The system might work all right.

He had been off on the ranges until night, so the exact locating will have to wait my next trip down.

There have been continuous and heavy north winds which have been drying up the hill sides badly -- this being my reason for telegraphing that the road men had not come.  Every one is hoping for more rain.

Mr. Rossi is centering work on the plunge, vestibule and Doges Suite, as the materials are being made in the work shops here (Van der LooÕs, SuppoÕs, etc.) for the other things decided on.

The buffalos have been put in the larger enclosure and looked very pretty browsing in the green grass.

Yours very truly,
