Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, California

March 31, 1933.

Miss Julia Morgan
San Francisco.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I am returning to Los Angeles this, Friday, night and will probably not be back for 
quite a little while.

So I will tell you later when I would like Miss Worn to come.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
