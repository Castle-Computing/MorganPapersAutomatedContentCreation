[Letter]

Dear Miss Morgan:

REFERRING TO SEVERAL ENCLOSURES

ITEM A

	I am enclosing a letter from Chester Beach, also a photograph of his prize winning group-- RISING MISTS OF THE SEA.  It seems interesting and appropriate to our fog-bound hill. Fifteen thousand dollars, though, is a terrible lot of money.  I am going to try to get it for less, or else not get it.


ITEM B

2. 	This Chinese scene seems to have some suggestions for our Chinese Hill construction.  Please file it among the Chinese data, all of which we will look over some time.

ITEM C

3.	This seems to me a fairly good type for the beach house library.

ITEM D

4.	I sent you this Poppy article before.  Will you kindly keep it on file for future reference, also the Rose article which I sent, which is still more important.

	The poppies are useful to us because they are apparently able to get along without water.  In fact they are not able to get along with water, so they would be useful in places we do not intend to irrigate-- for instance, along the road banks and even about the house where incessant water is not contemplated.

ITEM E

5.	I am sending you also an article about Lillies, which I consider important, too.

	It is very hard to get this gardner of ours to do lillies.  I have asked him for lillies twenty times, but have not got much of anything yet except the Easter lily type and those yellow calla lillies.

	Here is a little article which shows how many lillies there are which bloom during the summer.  In addition to the bulbs here mentioned there are what are called the semi-bulb type, the callas and the cannas, which are going to be quite wonderful in their variety and beauty.

	Cannas need mass planting.  They give great strokes of color in the landscape.  You probably notice in Los Angeles in the parks how effectively they can be used.  They can be used with equal effectiveness on the Hill;  in fact I think on the Hill we should do some groups of this kind, as the scale of everything is so large that little speckled planting does not get anywhere.

ITEM F

6.	We can get some of our best effects with petunias.  I do not think we should miss our beds of petunias in the replanting of the Temple Garden areas; or if we do not find opportunity there for the beds in sufficient quantities, let us string them all along that side of the Hill in banks above the road within the railing.

ITEM G

7.	I sent a lot of stuff up from the Beverley Hills Nursery.  I sent a little waxy plant about the color of bourgonvilla.  It is this I have always been trying to get as a border for the walks near the sea house, instead of which we got a yellow waxy plant, which was not what I was after.

	I think the use of this light purple flower which blooms profusely would be effective around House C, especially in borders.

ITEM H

8.	I think we should have a find showing of dahlias when the season comes, but I do not care much for chrysanthemums; they are too much trouble.

ITEM I

9.	I would be obliged if we could get rid of our present gardner as soon as convenient.  I am afraid he is a singularly unfortunate man for us.  He has not devised anything himself and he has undone a great many of the things that were planned by Mr. Webb.  It might be good to lay out our plans on paper with water colors or something, and leave a memorandum that could not be misinterpreted.

ITEM J	

10.  	I sent up a lot of South African marigolds.  I like those things because they bloom all summer and late into fall, provided they are planted so that they will.

The cannas and gladiolas also bloom all summer and late-- and also the petunias.

ITEM K

11.	I am enclosing a color sketch which, with a little more definiteness and some notations might make it impossible for the gardner to make mistakes.

ITEM L

12.	I hope we will get back to our helithrope as soon as possible.  That was one of the glories of the Hill, and I would like it liberally planted as it was before, but with a little more order and system.

ITEM M

13.	What do you think of getting Mr. Webb back.  He had his faults, but he was a gardner.

ITEM N

14.	When we get our ponds right, I would like to have a wonderful lot of water lillies.  They are beautiful flowers and interesting in their habits and habitats.

There is one kind that blooms in the day and another that blooms at night.

And this reminds me of the night garden we were going to have in the neighborhood of the pool and the Temple Garden.  There are a great many flowers which are sweeter at night and use their fragrance to attract the moths instead of the bees and the butterflies.

I think I sent you or showed you a list of flowers for a night garden that I got out of one of the magazines.  If you have that will you please use it in making the night garden.  If you have not, let me know and I will write to the garden magazines and try to get it.

ITEM O

15.	Enclosed is a picture of the room which I took as a motif for our big drawing room at the beach.

ITEM P

16.	When we come to the decoration of the interior of the beach house, in order to prevent too much similarity in the ten bedrooms, I think it might be well to have on the top floor for instance, one Dutch bedroom, one French bedroom, etcetera.

Of course the majority of the bedrooms would be straight Colonial, and I suggest on the second floor we use interesting papers with white wainscoating, etc.

On the top floor we might want to let the beams show, and get a little different type of treatment, all in the 18th Century period, however.

ITEM Q

17.	Enclosed is a little picture of Normandy beds.  We will get something like that for one room and I have a Dutch bed which I got from Falvy and which is stored somewhere.

ITEM R

18.	Do we use these vacuum cleaners on the Hill?  I would like to provide means of using them at the beach.  Also have house telephoned, radio connections, etc.

	I mention these because anything elaborate will have to be planned with the construction.

ITEM S

19.	Here are some towers etcetera to be filed away with the sketch of Persian building.

ITEM T

20.	Here are some pictures of fountains and staircase.  Will you please talk with me about them when you are at the ranch some time?

This is a sort of haphazard letter, but it has various things in it that I want to say.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
