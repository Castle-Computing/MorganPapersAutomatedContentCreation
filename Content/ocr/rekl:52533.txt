Dear Mr. Hearst:

It is necessary in order to be fair to the kind Honolulu clients, to make a quick Island trip - due to the new boat service, I will be back in San Francisco on February 11th.

I have gone over the warehouse photos, lists, etc. with the assistant in the office, Mrs. Knowles, who has charge of the photos, index cards, etc., - and who knows everything now at Bekins except the silver and miscellaneous cases in the vaults.  If you will kindly have the office called, she will be out at the warehouse any time you want her to tag discards and take notes of 'dispositions' generally.

Everything else, so far as I know, is well in hand - Miss Mesick is putting the changes on the model so as to better judge the comparative effect, - this including the dressing room terrace, stairways to the lower road fountain (below the temple), etc.

Mr. Joy will stay on the Hill as long as you want him.

I only decided a few days ago to go at this time.  It is never entirely convenient, but had to be done.

Yours very truly,
