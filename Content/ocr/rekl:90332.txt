Mr. William Randolph Hearst
La Cuesta Encantada
San Simeon, California 

Dear Mr. Hearst: 
	
	Mr. Williams telegraphed yesterday you wished
the silver bowl and pitcher returned immediately, whether
finished or not. I am doing so, although a few says more 
would make the inside of the bowl as good in tone as the outside. 

	The "bowl" was brought to me, the top crushed
in as though as object has fallen on it, or it had been stepped
on. I do not know who did it, or when.

	The Shreve people had done the Social Room
candlesticks so well I took it to them to re-form, It turned 
out that the bowl part of the basin is double of very thin 
silver -- and, to get the form back, they had to work each
separately and put them together again, -- all done too 
perfectly.

	The one silver worker on the coast who is 
expert at bringing patina back was not available until 
recently -- and had been patiently "rouging" the surfaces
by hand, having just about finished the under surfaces of
the bowl. 

	The pitcher has not been changed in any way --
was borrowed to show the craftsman the patina required. 

As always, 

JM:F
