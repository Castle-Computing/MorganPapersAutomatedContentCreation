November 29, 1922.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The fine selection of yellow materials from French's pleased me very much.  I gave Kreiss the heavier of the two brocades for the "B" chairs.  It is exactly right.  that hanging with the valance will certainly make a most gorgeous room and I can see us collecting all the red and yellow chairs, bed-spreads, etc.  already on the hill to go with it.

This is to enclose a list of "self-supporting" flowering shrubs.

Would you consider anything in the nature of the Burbank blackberry vines for bank planting?  Once established, they would stand the extra dryness of the banks.

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan
