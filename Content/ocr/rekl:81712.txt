Dear Mr. Hearst:

One more Hill family trouble I forgot to mention and we are over for this season -- 
concerning Divet, the French furniture repairer, who has been living in San Simeon and 
whom Mr. Parks and Mr. Slattery regard as a dangerous character to have about because 
in a family row he picked up a knife from the table and cut his son-in-law in the arm.

I had agreed, (this was while you were away) to discharge the man if you judged best 
on your return and consider it necessary therefore.

The son-in-law came here to the office and told me he felt he had been partly to blame 
in exasperating Mr. Divet, and that he held no grudge against him - that Divet had 
always been kind to them all and was not "mean", but that a combined household in 
trying quarters had not (naturally) worked out.

My solution was to pass the matter over as a strictly "in the family" affair, as Divet
 in all the years with us has never before shown bad temper and according to the boy 
 does not carry a knife and is not "mean".

As always

Yours very truly,
