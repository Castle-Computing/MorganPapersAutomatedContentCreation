Mr. William Randolph Hearst,

New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your suggestion for locating the farm group in the area of the Castro house seems to me to have may practical advantages --

1st. Water. The dam and lake in the Arroyo Seco would provide the necessary water for alfalfa, vegetables, canneries, etc. without depleting the Hill water supply.

It is certain that any dam built in the canyons above the camp will be very expensive to build and would impound the water of a comparatively small watershed --, also that a new reservoir will only provide a reserve for fire fighting or to tide over an accident to the main pipe line, -- not provide water for garden and orchard use.

2nd. Level Areas.  Watching the present experiment with the Jerseys, it is evident that, to even my eye, pastures for fine stock should be fairly level as they do not seem to have as much sense as the range cattle.  Also flats will be needed for drying trays (for raisins, peaches, etc.) as well as making all farm activities less expensive of operation as well as in first cost.

3rd. Farm Management.  After the last two years experiments I believe it will simplify keeping the farm help and as well as most of the "Staff" help if they are housed down below where they can get their own mail, provisions and amusements, and have their friends freely come and go.  It will simplify greatly guarding and protecting the Hill properties.  No one not on business will have any excuse for passing up the Hill road.
In another winter or two the road will be in such good shape that there will be no difficultly in the workers making their way up and down -- the trouble up to this year.

Also, the canneries, creameries, etc. would bring population up that might not be desirable.

4th.  This group could be very attractive.

Sincerely yours,
JM-deM
