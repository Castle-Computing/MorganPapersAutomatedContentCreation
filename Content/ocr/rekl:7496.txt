WILL YOU KINDLY WIRE HUMRICH DIRECT SAN SIMEON YOUR ORDERS FOR  TREATMENT OF HOUSE C EXTERIOR DOORS. I UNDERSTAND YOU WISH THEM  GAY IN COLOR. THE OVER DOORS, PANELS, ETC. ARE COMPLETE. IT SEEMS  TO ME THE OLD OAK WILL COUNT FOR MORE FOR A FEW YEARS THAN THE  SHAPE OF THE POOL; I MEAN UNTIL NEW PLANTING BECOMES ESTABLISHED.  HAD MODEL OF SWIMMING POOL SKETCH UNDER WAY WHEN YOUR LETTER CAME.   WILL HURRY IT.. HOUSE B MODEL NEARLY DONE.
