Dear Mr. Hearst:

This is just to say Mr. Rossi is following schedule, the plumbers and plasterers at work on interior of Neptune pavilion - which is cleared of the wood forms, Macklen's men clearing off the space toward B Terrace, the curved concrete wall on this side of the pool nearly demolished and considerable grading done. Mr. Rossi agreed regretfully to deepen the C walls instead of bringing over the trees, and is working on excavating out around the plaza oak.  The day was rainy with a regular winter wind, making work practically impossible outside.  There is a very great deal to do before the torn up areas will be presentable -- but I think real work had been done during the week.  The roses were superb -- never saw finer.

I took up a customs man to see the broken roof tile and the big fountain from Germany which was passed through without being inspected by courtesy so as to allow its being transferred directly to a San Simeon boat.  He will recommend the refund of the tile deposit and needed only one look at the fountain to pass it.

Yours very truly,
