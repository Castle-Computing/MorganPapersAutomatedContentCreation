Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Harold Vanderbiltâ€™s Palm Beach home seems to contain a suggestion of the Moorish, not any too well done to be sure, but about the extent of  Moorish influence that I should think we might get in Cottage C.

Please notice the three windows on the exterior of one plan. I have put a ring around them.  And please notice a glimpse through the trees of a double window in the other picture.  It is similarly marked.

There is also a rather nice idea in the interior of this house.  Valences are put around as sort of a frieze on a plain wall.  I have never noticed this done before, but there is a mighty good effect and I am going out to try to find some valences to use in this way.

2.  I am enclosing a plan of House B, interior.  I miss the lobby that we have in the other houses, and I think the sitting room is perhaps unnecessarily large.

How would it do to make a lobby; that is, to put up a wall where the fold of the paper is ,and where I have drawn a line across with a pencil-- and to take the fireplace out of the lobby where it now is and put it into this sitting room; in other words, to move it forward about eight feet.

3. Those bracketed capitals-- see enclosed drawing -- are very Spanish, but I do not know how they will go with the marble columns I have been able to buy and send out to the Coast.

Use your own judgment in the matter, but do not feel compelled to use the bracketed capitals merely to get the Spanish effect if the columns and capitals that we have are better without it.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
