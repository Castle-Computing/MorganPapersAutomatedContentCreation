Mr. William Randolph Hearst, 
Los Angeles Examiner,
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	You have so much fine red damask we could use,
a red and yellow set would not make a very different expression.
If we trust San Simeon, surely he will provide some other color
sooner or later. He always does.

	I went over the garden carefully yesterday. Mr. 
Reesing has covered all the bougainvillaeas except in C court - 
also the hibiscus. None of the camillias or gardenias are even 
frost bitter, and are bursting with buds. The cold did take
off the last of the roses - and there are few plants really
in bloom, but oranges in the little beds are brilliant and the 
last of the petunias, jasmines, etc. give color.

	Mr. Reesing had just brought in two of the largest
and finest camellia trees you could ever have seen. Miss
Worn located them some time ago in an old garden near San
Leandro. They will stay boxed until you see them.

	It rained so much last week Mr. Rossi could not
take the forms off the new tower, but all other work is at the
stage described to you last Tuesday. Mr. Rossi comes down
before Christmas Day leaving Ray Van Gorden as connector-up.
There are about twenty-five men in the camp, gardeners, animal 
and orchard men, cook, waiter, and janitor. Mr Williams has
much to do yet on the furniture fumigation,- it will take all
winter to get into good condition - where you want him to stop
off. 

	In general, things are in good shape - all
fireplaces X seeming to work.

	Yours very truly,
	
	JM-M
