1135 Merchants Exchange Bldg.,
San Francisco, Calif.

Miss Morgan and Miss Worn our begonias have all gone toot this year and our asters 
are a total failure and various things like these and like the gladioli which used to
 be the pride of the place have practically faded out of the picture.  Mr. Chatfield 
 has various explanations none of which are any good.  My opinion is that Mr. Chatfield
  has no organization.  He has no gardeners.  He has a lot of waterers a number of 
  small boys who squirt water on everything as if they were putting out a fire.  
  The plants are beaten down by water.  The blooms are knocked off by water.  These 
  youths have no knowledge no experience no patience and no love for the work.  I want
   some gardeners like Tony and if Mr. Chatfield doesn't get them I wish you would 
   kindly get them and give each one of them his special job just as we have given 
   Tony then we can see how good each one is.  We need division of labor and individual
    responsibility. We need

an organization of good men each with a definite piece of work to do.  Lets get rid 
of the children and install some grownup gardeners like Tony.  By the way Tony wants to 
leave.  I would rather have all the rest of them leave and if Tony should leave the rest
 of them surely will.
