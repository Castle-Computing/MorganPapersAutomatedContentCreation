Dear Miss Morgan:

Have just sent you a telegram regarding the planting plans of Mr. Porter.  Have also returned his report with notations.  You will observe that I am very greatly pleased with the general outlines of the report.

I approve of the scheme of planting, but I think it would be better to employ in planting evergreen trees as a general proposition, only using deciduous trees for certain localities and for a certain variety.

As I said in the telegram the natural foliage of the ranch is almost entirely evergreen, the conifers on the mountains and the live oaks in the gulleys, etc.,  This gives a beautiful effect, both in the summer and winter, and I would not like to modify that effect by planting any considerable number of deciduous trees for certain localities and for a certain variety.

As I said in the telegram the natural foliage of the ranch is almost entirely evergreen, the conifers on the mountains and the live oaks in the gulleys, etc., This gives a beautiful effect, both in the summer and winter, and I would not like to modify that effect by planting any considerable number of deciduous trees.

I suggest, therefore, that we use only a limited number of deciduous trees, and those for express purposes.  For instance, we could use fruit trees and nut trees rather freely, it would be good to plant fruit trees outside the fences of the orchard as Mr. Porter suggests.  That makes the planting less set and gives, as he says, a certain impression of age.

the nut trees, particularly the walnuts, can be used along the roads and the other nut planting as he suggests.  It must be borne in mind in all this planting that the climatic conditions of the ranch are enormously different in various altitudes and various locations, and that tin some places almost tropical vegetation will thrive and other places it will not, and that in other places where the fog is bad certain fruit trees do not do so well while, however, on the hill side the fruits and nuts do marvelously well.

In addition to the fruit and nut trees I was anxious to have a few specimens of various interesting trees, mainly evergreens but some deciduous.  I have mentioned on occasions the cork oak as an example and the eSt. Jacob's bread and one or two other varieties which I cannot now recall, but which I took from the Niles catalogue.
A further important line of tree planting is the flowering tree.  These I like very much personally and moreover I realize their effect on eastern visitors.  There are various types of these trees, the various flowering eucalypti, Jacaranda, Acacia, particularly the constantly blooming Acacia, Magnolias, etc.,

It may be desirable to plant most of these flowering trees within the larger enclosure beginning at the gate so that they will be seen on Chinese Hill, Garage Hill and on the bathing house hill and more or less conspicuous places of that kind, but I should think some of the flowering Eucalypti especially can be planted further down towards the trough and towards the ranch house and towards SanSimeon.

Instead of using the flowering Eucalypti restrictedly, therefore, I would like to use them a little more liberally as Mr. Porter suggests.

I agree with him, however, with the general outline except on reservoir hill which I would like to see as completely as possible covered with conifers.  First, because I want the conifers and second, I think that hill is one of the few things that is not very pretty as it stands and can be made wonderfully pretty as  a conifer-covered mountain.  Other conifers can be used at selected points from the hill down to the ranch and on to San Simeon very much as Mr. Porter is now planning.

2.  The next thing to take up is the planting on the banks of the road, the grading on the banks for this planting and the construction of a curb as shown in the sketches.

I agree that this shrub planting should be, in the main, native California stuff, but there are a great many drought-resisting flowering shrubs that are not native and which have been transplanted to California and so much used that they can almost be regarded as native.  I would like to use these drought-resisting flowering shrubs liberally, and I would particularly like to use those that flower during the summer months.  I think it would be well to scatter in among these, however, some winter flowering shrubs in berrying varieties so that we would have some life to the road landscape even in winter.  These roadside plantings, however, must positively be able to take care of themselves.  we will have no time to pamper them.  The selection must be made with that understanding.

3.  Regarding the minor architectural additions suggested, I like the idea of a decent Inn at San Simeon and this we will construct.  I like the idea of having something at the trough which I hope you will submit designs for.  I think a  shrine at the proper place would also be good, but I do not know where the proper place is as yet.  It may be at the gate where the bend is.  In fact we might combine something with the gate.  Of course, that will be left to your judgment.
4.  I think we should have ac certain more or less stiff avenue of trees from San Simeon to the ranch house for all of the way or at least part of the way.  I think this avenue should be either of lowering Eucalypti or of big black walnut trees, and that the trees should be planted so as to leave a very wide road between, maybe a double road, and that they should not be planted too near together.

I think the straightness of this avenue, at least to the top of the shelving hill would be beneficial.  I mean by that that the actual stiffness would be desirable.  From the ranch house up I doubt if we should have any such rigid avenue for two reasons.  First, because you run into a different kind of country, and second, because you speedily get on higher ground where there are views to b ahead, and nothing is more aggravating than having stiff lines of trees cutting out the views.

The planting here, therefore, should be of the kind Mr. Porter suggests and very limited in amount.  When we get to the trough we can use sycamores because sycamores would do well near that seepage of water.  we can plant the sycamores keeping in mind the little architectural effect so that they will harmonize.

From there up to the gate we adopt Mr.Porter's plan of planting, but as I say, use evergreens mainly and perhaps St.John's bread because, as I understand it, that is good for the cattle and there will be cattle ranging here.  We might have a clump of cork oaks or individual cork oaks planted and other individual trees, and have the hilltop crowned with some conifers.

When we get to the gate we begin to get into civilized area.  We come into the orchard and according to my plan the farm houses, and this means the cultivated area.  From there on I think we can use the roadside shrub planting and the flowering trees with effect.

I think Mr. Porter's idea of not allowing anything to interfere with the view of the walls is excellent nd we will try to comply with that suggestion. 

I would advise that we do not disturb any of the citrus planting at present.  We have to find out where the citrus trees will grow.  I advise planting them liberally however, where we think they might grow.  They will thin themselves out in most places by dying, and we can thin them out ourselves later if we find they interfere with he views we want to retain.
I like Mr. Porter's idea of planting fig trees along the road and to plant olive trees at San Simeon if they will grow there.  I think the fig trees are very beautiful and characteristic of the country, so too would some alligator pear trees be.  So too would grape vines be which Mr. Porter suggests, and perhaps some blackberry growths.  They are what eastern people expect of California.  Moreover, they are picturesque and also sometimes useful.

Are these haphazard notes clear?  Suppose Mr.Porter tries to embody some of them in his detailed suggestions.  Then we can discuss them further.  When you have sent me the Niles Catalogue I will make some further minor suggestions.

Sincerely,
s/W R Hearst
