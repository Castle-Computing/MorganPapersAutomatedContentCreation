(Letterhead: New York American)

December 6, 1921.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have bought some old Roman oil jars in Italy.  They will be sent out to Coast and will arrive in due time.  I am enclosing a postcard which shows how they are mounted in some places in Italy.

If we find them satisfactory, we might use them in a similar way on our terraces.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
