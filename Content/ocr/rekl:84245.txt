Dear Miss Morgan:

We have got to make some economies on account of the dull times.  I think we can 
condense our various forces as much as possible.  Furthermore, we must have as 
much cooperation as possible between the departments, so that fewer men will do 
the work.

We do not want to overwork anybody but conditions require a little more care and 
attention.

I think Mr. Summers, with one reliable man, can take charge of the warehouses and 
save quite a lot of money and do everything there carefully.

He is right on the ground and there is really not a great deal to be done.

The warehouses are pretty full and have to be watched and properly protected.

This is Mr. Parks suggestion and I approve of it under the circumstances.

Mr. Keep is an awfully good man but he likes to pay his people above the wages 
that prevail in similar departments.  He has made it a little disturbing for us 
in good times.  That policy would be worse now.  I am going to try to get him to 
adopt the prevailing scale of wages and to run as small a force as possible until 
things improve.

I think the household is being well managed.  Mrs. O'Brien is very economical and 
I have given her absolute authority over Albert and the others so she will keep them 
in check.

I think our gardner is disposed to be careful in expenses, and if you speak to Mr. 
Rossi we will keep that department within bounds also.

I guess that covers the whole situation.

I am enclosing a check for $15,000.  Will you let me know about what you will 
require this month?

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
