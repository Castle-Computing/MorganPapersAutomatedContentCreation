Miss A. M. Flood
Secretary to 
Mr. John Francis Neylan
Crocker First National Bank Building
San Francisco, California

Dear Miss Flood:

	We do not know the rental
agreement arranged for with the Stringer Storage
Company, so can not pass on the general storage 
bill.

	However, we do look after moving
and packing of articles from the warehouse to the 
customs court, etc., and in January okehed the 
bills enclosed. 

	Very truly yours,
	
	JM:F
	Enc.
