Dear Mr. Hearst:

To make sure you approve, am sending a copy of a letter to Mr. McGregor asking for a 
ceiling shipment.  These cover -

	The ceiling material for the Gothic Study

	The ceiling for the Billiard Room

	The painted late paneled Italian ceiling for the Lower West Duplex - the 	painted 
	panel to go over the bed space of this suite.

Also two painted flat board ceilings from French & Co., 11' -6" x 16'-0".  These are 
the only ones you have not authorized sending for.  They look interesting, and might 
both be used instead of the Italian one above, and the panel.

Yours very truly,
