October 8, 1923.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Rossi's report covers the ground to date very well -- I had to grin a little in reading it.  It is true that the garden has been and still is lovely and without undue care.  both Mr. Keep and Mr. Webb had their vacations and are ready for the fall planting.

I am sending a detailed drawing of House C towers using one of the two little odicules you sent, with extensions,a nd some of the old beam ends as corbels.  The larger one you sent has such a good ceiling it seems too bad to use it, as it could be set up as a whole in the court of the Arabian building or upon one of its flat decks.  I do not see how we can project out further as the little towers would be swamped.  The lavatories are usable though not spacious.

Yours  very truly,

JM-deM
