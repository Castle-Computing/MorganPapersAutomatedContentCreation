Dear Mr. Hearst,-

There were shipped to San Simeon on the original contract for pergola columns, 177 
columns.  We used a few as culverts. There are 160 columns at the pipe company's pant
 which we persuaded them not to ship at the time work was held up, so there are 
 approximately 300 columns on hand.  The Company has been very accommodating but will 
 be glad to complete delivery of those on hand.  The contract stands as originally
  made, but I think they will be glad to cancel the balance of the order.

Any left over columns can be used as culverts as not more expensive than the usual pipe
 in short lengths.

Very truly yours,



JM-m
