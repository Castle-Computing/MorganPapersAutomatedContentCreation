(Letterhead: HOTEL ST. FRANCIS, UNION SQUARE, SAN FRANCISCO)

Dear Miss Morgan:

Here is a sort of  a plan of what I talked to you about. The ground there accomodates itself to this manner of treatment.

This should give a wide appearance as well as deep and would think get the imposing front (or back rather) that we desire.
I prefer a pool - perhaps with a central fountain and a wall fountain at the back as people in the loggia and in the upper terraces couldn't see the back wall foundation but would get a very charming view of a Moorish pool with tile and a central fountain of some kind.

Sincerely,
s/ W. R. Hearst
