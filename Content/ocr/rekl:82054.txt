MEMORANDUM FOR MR. CHATFIELD--

JULY 24 1929

I like broad color schemes in the garden with relation to the various houses, but I do 
not think all the planting should be solid colors by any means.

For instance, the begonias were very beautiful under the trees last year on account of 
the diversity of color.  I do not think they would be as pretty in solid masses of 
color.

Furthermore, the herbaceous borders should have a sufficient variety of flower and 
color.  My complaint about them this year was the there was not a sufficient 
representation of the flowers that are favorites of mine, such as the gladiola.

That, of course, was mainly due to the fact that you did not know yet what flowers 
were desired.

I am writing this letter to say that I think for the Fall, we should have a fine 
assortment of magnificent dahlias, and also a liberal showing of asters.

It occurs to me that it might be a good idea to make a list and a plan for Spring 
gardening, Summer gardening, Fall gardening, and Winter flowers.

I believe by putting things down on paper in some detail we would save a good deal of 
experimenting, only part of which would be successful.
