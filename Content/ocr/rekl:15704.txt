Dear Miss Morgan:

Assuming that you accept my suggestion of planting the jacaranda from the new gate up to the intersection of the roads at Chinese Hill, along the south road, and the crepe Myrtle on the north road, and the eucalyptus from the intersection of the roads up to the houses, why would it not be well to plant blue plumbago with the jacaranda and white plumbago the with crepe myrtle (which is pink) and heliothrope with the eucalyptus?

The two shades of blue would go well, I think, and the pink and white would go well.

The only question is how well the orange red of the eucalyptus would go with the mauve of the heliothrope.  I think it would be good, and heliothrope is so sweet and does so wonderfully well on the Hill, that I think we could make the planting and flowering a success.

If you think yellow cassia would be better with the eucalyptus, we can consider that.  It flowers plentifully and has a vivid yellow, but it has no sweet scent.  Personally I am inclined to favor heliothrope.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
