Dear Miss Morgan:

I received the topographical map with the location of the cottages.  They are located exactly right according to my best judgement without being on the ground.  So far as location is concerned, please proceed with erection of the cottages.

The shape of the ground floor indication from the little papers pasted on the map surprised me somewhat and I sent you a telegram in regard to them.  Perhaps these little models were not meant to be accurate.

I had wired you previously, however, kindly to make an enclosed lobby instead of a porch at the court entrance of my house.  I think my house is likely to be occupied sometimes during the winter and such an enclosed lobby would be most desirable to keep the wet and the wind out of the main living room and to give anyone a place to take off their wet coats and their wet and muddy overshoes, etc.

It looked from the little paper plans as if there were no such lobby on my house but such lobbies had been added to the other houses, B and C.  I judged this from the shallowness of the courts.

Moreover, I wrote you about the screen I had bought and suggested that it be placed at the north side of the living room, directly opposite the front windows, with entrance doors on each side and with the fireplace removed from there and fireplaces put at each end of the library alcoves.

I understood that you approved of this treatment, but said it would necessarily make the living room wider, to which I have no objection.

I judged from the little plans that this had not been done, however; and I am anxious to have it done, unless you find objection to it.

I always want to know your views when they conflict with my suggestions, and I am disposed to defer to your better judgement.  But if there is no objection to the above ideas, I would like them put into the plans and into the houses.

I am sending you some old Spanish tiles, merely as motifs for the frieze under the cornice around the cottages.  The best one is the lustrous one with the inscription, and I would selfishly like that around my house.

I imagine these escutcheons should not come right up against each other but should be separated by three or 

2.

four feet of scroll or floriated or geometrical ornament of some kind which you will design, if you u please.

The other motifs can be used around the other houses, and I thought the motif  with the relief escutcheon might be used around the big house, if you wanted to use that frieze idea around the big house.

But doubtless it would be desirable to vary the treatment there and not have this tile frieze.  Anyhow, we have time enough to decide on that matter.

How big an entrance door do you contemplate for the big building?  There are some grilled doors and other portals to be bought here, but I do not want to buy anything which will not harmonize with your plans.

Sincerely yours,
