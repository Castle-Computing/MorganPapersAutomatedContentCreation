Dear Mr. Hearst:

In case you want to reach me, I will be on the Hill Monday.

There are interesting reports on Mountolive and studies for adapting the plan to 
actual measurements - also the pool wall tile samples need your eye.

Thank you for letting me know you would not be up this Sunday.

As always,

Yours very truly,
