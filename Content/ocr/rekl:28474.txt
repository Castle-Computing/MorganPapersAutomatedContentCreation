Dear Mr. Hearst:

I am very glad you are coming this week as enough has been done on towers and stone work to judge effect by.  The palms and yews need to be placed.  They were too fine to risk wrong placing, so were reboxed and held.

The tennis court will not be ready for two weeks -- two new cave-ins of the high bank apparently solid rock.

We are making the Gothic Suite usable without the paneling, and cleaning up the three rooms and two baths.  You can plan safely on using them for Saturday night. There will be some camoflage - but the bulk of the work is done.

Practically without exception there has been unusually good spirit shown by the men these weeks, and I think if we could keep the present crews another four weeks there could be a real finish on the original part of the work.

Yours very truly,
