Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mildred Byne wrote last fall that they had crossed and recrossed Spain in the quest for a cloister or palace for you. -- This is just out and I suppose is in the nature of an answer as to cloisters.

The blue slips are put in where the cloister is "abandoned".

What a wealth of suggestive material this little book contains.

Yours very truly,

[attached receipt]
