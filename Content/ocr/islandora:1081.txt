YOU NEED NOT MAKE MOORISH SKETCHES I AM SURE THAT RENAISSANCE TREATMENT IS BEST SKETCHES NUMBER TWO AND REAR ARE VERY SATISFACTORY THROUGHOUT EXCEPT WINDOWTREATMENT WEGREATLY PREFER THE RENAISSANCE WINDOW TREATMENT ON SKETCHES ONE BUT EVERYTHING ELSE IS BETTER ON SKETCHES TWO WE NOW EVEN PREFER THE CORNICE OF SKETCH TWO PROVIDED THE DETAILS MODELED INTERESTINGLY ON THE REAR ELEVATION I THINK YOU COULD PUT THREE OF THESE RENAISSANCE 
WINDOWS WITH THE GARLANDS AND PUTTI ON EACH WING AND FOUR IN THE CENTER  THUS MAKING ALMOST THE WHOLE UPPER PART WINDOWS SOME EMPHASES IN DECORATION COULD BE LAID ON THE TWO MIDDLE WINDOWS OF THE CENTER PERHAPS THEY COULD BE MADE INTO ONE BIG VIEW WINDOW THE LOWER ARCHES OF THE LOGGIA NEED SOME ADDED DECORATION THEN SKETCHES TWO WILL BE PERFECT
