September 23, 1927.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Referring to my letter of September 21st, regarding linenfold panelling bought by Miss Head:

Miss Head's letter does not describe the panelling, but I believe there was a description on the back of the photograph, telling from whom it was bought etc.

Will you kindly describe this panelling to me, so that I may instruct Miss McGregor to send it to San Simeon.

Sincerely,

s/ H.O. Hunter
Secretary to Mr. Hearst
