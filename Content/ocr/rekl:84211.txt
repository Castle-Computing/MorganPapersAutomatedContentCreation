Mount Vernon, Virginia

January 6, 1931.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I should have replied more punctually to your very kind note of the 22d ultimo but 
for the fact that my attempt to get a kodak picture of the blue vase was 
unsuccessful, and I have been obliged to send you, instead, a photograph of it in 
miniature as it appears in one of the illustrations of our guide book here.

I have cited its measurements and general appearance, and feel sure that you will 
find no difficulty in selecting the vase which Mr. Hearst had (after his mother's 
death), and which he promised me he would give to Mount Vernon at any time we 
wanted it.  We very much desire it at this particular time to stand with its mate 
(as they did originally) in the Banquet Hall here which has recently been very 
beautifully restored.

The Ladies are to have a special meeting on the 22d of February, and I do hope 
that you will find it possible to have the vase reach us by that date.

Believe me

Very cordially yours,

s/ Harrison H. Dodge

Superintendent.
