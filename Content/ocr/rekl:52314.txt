Dear Mr. Hearst:

We have the heavy power line over your property to the power house and up to serve the houses with their new heaters, etc.  But it still leaves the necessity of adding to the present transformers if a large proportion of lights and heaters are likely to be on at one time this winter.  The five units necessary will cost about $4000.00, practically cash payment.

From your own program, would you think it necessary to get them in during November?

Yours very truly,
