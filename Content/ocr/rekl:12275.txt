Dear Miss Morgan:

The plan for the garden between B and c received.  It seems to me quite right and gives proper opportunity for the Temple to dominate it.

Regarding the pepper boxes--I do not quite understand.  I imagine you mean you have masked them with shrubbery, on account of their not harmonizing in size with the Temple.  This is quite satisfactory to me, but you might prefer to make the pepper boxes larger.  I have no objection to that either if you so decide; in fact, it might look better from the road and from the distant approaches.

I do not know how it will look, however, from the garden side; so I will leave the matter to your judgment.

2. Please go ahead immediately with the blue, green, and gold set for house B.  cover it with the antique gold brocade if you like it.  It seems to me that that is exactly what it needs.

3. Please wire me on receipt of this kind of material required for Mrs. Hearst's set and what color you want.  I can probably get the material at French's give me as much detail as possible and you would better follow up the telegram with some samples.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
