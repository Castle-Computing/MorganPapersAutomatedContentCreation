Dear Mrs. Hearst:

In regard to the use of California versus foreign cement --

The San Marcos building at Santa Barbara did not fail because of salt water in the cement or sand, but because of design, (perhaps an element being the shape of the building itself), and because of the poor quality of the Santa Barbara sand and rock.

The danger in using foreign cement is in the possibility of its setting or caking either because of getting wet in transit and warehouses.  As foreign cement is usually packed in barrels lined with waterproof heavy paper the caking is generally slight and confined to about an inch at the heads.  As local cement is packed in cloth sacks, unless kept well protected it runs considerable risk of caking all over.

In the interest of the work, my own solution of the foreign cement question is to call in the specifications for a Òbrand of California Portland cement to meet fully all the standard tests of the American Society of Testing EngineersÓ.

Most cities now require regular tests on all cement used at the cost of the owner, directly or indirectly, requirements being the development of certain minimum strengths in seven and twenty-eight days respectively.

Yours very truly,
