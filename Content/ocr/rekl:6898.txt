Dear Miss Morgan:

Am I right in assuming that the contents of the envelopes surreptitiously opened were intact? Could you state just what was received in either case, and oblige, 

Sincerely Yours,
 s/ J Willicombe 

In this way I hope to be able to check up and make certain that nothing was lost or stolen.
