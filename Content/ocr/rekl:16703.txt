Dear Miss Morgan:

We ought to have some protection from the draught when the door of the West lobby opens - in this windy cold weather.  

1.  Shall we put merely heavy curtains across the opening into the big room?

2.  Shall we put a grille as well as curtains

3. Should we not also have wooden doors at the entrance - either inside as at the last lobby
or outside as we once planned for this West entrance.

It would make the main room more cozy in appearance as well as in temperature if we had some such protective feature.

As things are now the library is rapidly becoming the living room on account of its superior warmth and comfort.

We had a lively time in house A last night. The storm was severe and I spent most of the night ripping off the weather stripping in my room  The darn stuff sounded like a flock of saxophones going at full tilt in a jazz band.  We must make all these exposed rooms in A and in the other houses too - and in
the main house water air and noise proof.

We must reconstruct the windows.  They should be made heavier and should have sills and should also have the dove tail type of weather stripping.

I advised Mr. Rossi to make two inch oak doors inside and outside on the double windows and to use plate glass twice as thick as he now has and to put the long French bolts inside
and out.  We must build these windows as if we were on ship board.  We have almost the same storm and strain to encounter.

In the big house let us realize in advance what we have to meet and have everything built of the heaviest material at first so there need be no change

I have been looking over the patio.  I think the two stories can be carried around the whole tip(?) on each side except for about twenty feet north and south of the main building.  That twenty feet on each side would be a sort of a light well giving light to the windows of the bed rooms in the Doges Suite.  This light well could
be decorated with the pergolas(?) as you suggested.  This second story construction should give us about four comfortable bed rooms and accessories on each side - eight in all   The south side bed rooms could be used by the heads of household stuff.  The north side bed rooms by guest.  We must manage 5 (?) in stairways somewhere inside the building.

The towers I think can be carried up prettily and made as tall as the architectural
requirements demand.  We can put pigeons in them and feed the pigeons in the court as they do in Venice.

Regarding the garage - I think we should have low buildings around a longer court or possibly two courts  The garage I suppose should be on the side nearest our hill - the quarters of the help on the east side. Chauffeurs gardners electricians horse men and men help of nearly every kind can live over there - those who dont live at the bay.  I imagine they should have their own cook kitchen and dining room and I think only the distinctly domestic help should be on our hill.

Over on garage hill should
be the saddle room the gun room and at least a couple of other well ordered store rooms with cedar closets where riding clothes tennis duds and the various sizes and kinds of boots breeches coats hats etc what it is necessary for us to keep in stock for visitors can be carefully classified and neatly kept until required.  One room should be for mens clothes, one for womens, etc. We can have storage space enough 
over there.

There will be shops over there too machine shop, blacksmith(?) shop electricians  shop and aparatus.  These might well be on the north side where not very noticable

I think we can find practical satisfaction of many of our needs over there.

Sincerely

s/ WR Hearst
