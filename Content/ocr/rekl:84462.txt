Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst instructed me to send you the enclosed pictures of some Spanish Renaissance limestone baluster panels submitted by French & Co.  He says the price is $200 for each panel and they are all in perfect condition.  He has 18 of some kind and 19 of the other, making 101 running feet, as they are 2'6' high and 3' wide.  Samuels of Frency & Co. suggests they might be used as a dado around a room by simply adding a little pilaster and a capping and small base.  Mr Hearst says:

'ASK MISS MORGAN IF SHE WANTS THESE THINGS; PERSONALLY I AM NOT INCLINED TO TAKE THEM.'

Kind advise,

Sincerely,

s/ J Willicombe
