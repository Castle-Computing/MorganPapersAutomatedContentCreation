Sept. 3rd, 1931

Dear Mr. Hearst:

After writing the last letter, your London message was received allowing the San 
Simeon work to go on until December.  As reported before, the "taking out has been 
a longer task than expected, but the erecting of the new work we hope will be faster.
  The steel roof trusses for over the study are being raised this week, and we are 
  concentrating on getting the Gothic baths back into usable shape.  The dressing 
  room section am finishing permanent materials, but the new bath addition am just 
  plastering, partly to save expense and partly to make sure you approve before 
  putting permanent finish in.

We have resumed work on the Neptune Pool enlargement but are leaving in the wall 
between the deepened and the enlarged ladies' pool and the main Basin so that, should 
we need to stop again, the use of the big pool would not be interrupted.

The gardener is to try operating with three less men and we are holding our own force
 down as low as possible.  The flowers have been marvelous all summer and I do hope 
 Mr. Reesing will be able to hold the effect over until your arrival.  The polar 
 bears seem to be doing very well.  There has been lots of fruit.

Yours very truly,
