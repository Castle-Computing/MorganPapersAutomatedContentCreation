Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.	The Indian blankets were very carefully packed with camphor, but will have the 
trunks opened, carefully examined and repacked with fresh material.

There are other trunks from the Hacienda that should be inspected and the garments 
and materials refolded.  It was done while you were on your "trip before the last 
one" to Europe.  It is not the kind of handling Mr. Williams can do well.

2.  As to unburnable toilet seats: - The only ones so far located are the brown or 
black rubberoid, such as used in trains.  The white and colored finishes are put on 
over wood or composition base.

3.  The pads for rugs are ordered.

As always,
