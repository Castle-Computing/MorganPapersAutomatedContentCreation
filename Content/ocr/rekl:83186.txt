Dear Mr. Hearst:

When Mr. Slattery told me you wanted Mr. Chatfield to stay, I tried - and Miss Worn 
also - to see if the reasons for his contacts with Mr. Rossi could not be sufficiently 
lessened to make the position see desirable to him again, but it only developed the 
depth of his feeling against Mr. Rossi.  I am sorry, as changes are not for the good
 of the garden, and I am not too sure that Mr. Webb will be happy -- although he says 
 he will be and that he will never "resign" again -- that you will have to personally 
 "fire him" if you want him to leave the Hill.  It will seem almost like a new place, 
 and it will take him a bit of time to pick up the new scheme.  I told Mr. Slattery
  Monday that he was available, and of your telegraphing to make the change ( if it had
   to be made) as soon as possible.

Yours very truly,

Mr Webb has no doubt but that he will be happy & capable.
