Dear Miss Morgan:

I think it would help to separate Rossi's expenses into divisions.

For instance, the kitchen, janitor, Rossi's office, are more or less fixtures, and not 
directly construction workers.  The same thing applies to Mr. Williams and his helpers, 
who should be in this first division.

Mr. Rossi's incidental bills may be included in this, and also the camp food supplies, 
the gas and oil, and auto repairs and parts.

Another division is the actual workers, such as teamsters, laborers, carpenters and 
helpers, electricians and helpers, stone-setters, tile-setters, plasterer and helper, 
painters, plumbers, casterstone men, chimneymen, and treemen, the payrool at San Simeon 
and poultry plant.  In this division also could be included Mr. Rossi's salary.

A third division is purchases and supplies such as lumber, plumbing supplies, electrical
 supplies, plain and ornamental tile shipment, shipment of mosaic for Neptune plunge, 
 and installment of warehouse fire system, etc.

That makes roughly four divisions.

The reason for making these divisions is desirability of clarifying the expenses in 
different directions and determining what the essential expenses are towards progress 
on the Hill.

I have gotten Mr. Slattery's expenses down under $15,000.  I think I would like to add a 
few men on the actual Hill payrool in order to get in more workers.

I am sure we could spend $12,000 on the actual Hill payroll, possible $15,000.  We will 
keep the poultry plant and San Simeon payrolls as they are, the warehouse payrolls as 
they are, and San Francisco payrolls as they are, because the men would be added to the 
Hill payroll largely for mere concrete development.

Then with the various supplies and purchases in one division, I think we can proceed to 
clear up budget payments, such as the marble work, the warehouse fire system, etc., and 
get them out of the way.

If you will let me know what we owe on these I will send you the money to make the 
payments, and we will get on a basis of a little quicker progress.

Sincerely,
