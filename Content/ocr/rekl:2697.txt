Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst told me to send you the enclosed bill from the City Nursery of Santa Barbara-- paid-- and to ask you when the planting can begin.

"Ask Miss Morgan also," Mr. Hearst said, "how things are getting on and can she send me some photographs, as I am beginning to get worried for fear we will not be able to get into the houses next summer."

Sincerely,
s/ J. Willicombe
Secretary to Mr. Hearst
