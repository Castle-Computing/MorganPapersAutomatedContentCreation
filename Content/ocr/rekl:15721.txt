Dear hr. anret:

, We laid the Befectcry ceiling all out on
the Social Room floor n and for a time it eeemed
uneclvahly too big. but at the leet moment-an idea
came that I think will work. in any case it will
allow the.ceiling to go up without any cutting so
that if.you judge the scale too large it will not
be much effort to get~it down at some future time,
intact. the idea is this ~- VThe octagonal panels
are made like ooverleee hexee with a collar or
flange around the edge. By loosening up at A, the
collar can be clipped down as in Sketch oz, and a
moulding be added to take card of the aonearance.
Then the beams can be put up without any eidee,
(see Sketch $2). . s . ‘ »

Those with the lowering of the plaster
moulding now in place against the wall will give no
room juet by the skin of its teeth.~

After puzzling all day over the effect, I
have come to thio conclusion; ~~ there is beauty and
charm in the indefinite, intangible thing, that leads
the imagination on -- and we had that the other night

»with the gray beams end'their soft shadows -- and
- ‘there is the beauty and interest in fine strong de~

i dinite and imaginative detail which this ceiling will
bring;into the room. Perhaps the flatness forced by
conditions-will make this large scale ceiling tie
into its surroundings as it would not with its origi-
-nal heavy deep beams and deep panels. in-any case
we have glimpsed one room and will'have another ---
and it will be interesting to compare the effects.

Sunday I made the necessary drawings 30

. that hr. Roeei could go ahead and put up one eec«
tion of the ceiling across the room, as a tryout,~~
and will go beck ae econ as he has it up.

The steel Was all placed Saturday for the

main pool floor which will bu poured tomcra w -- and
it will eertainly be ready for the marble by the
time it arrives. i have asked 5r. R0331 not to di-
vert on other work outside the building until he

Yours very truly,
