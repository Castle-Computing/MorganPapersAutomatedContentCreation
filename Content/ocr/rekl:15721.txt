Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

We laid the Refectory ceiling all out on
the Social Room floor - and for a time it seemed
unsolvably too big. but at the last moment an idea
came that I think will work. in any case it will
allow the ceiling to go up without any cutting so
that if you judge the scale too large it will not
be much effort to get it down at some future time,
intact. The idea is this -- The octagonal panels
are made like coverless boxes with a collar or
flange around the edge. By loosening up at A, the
collar can be clipped down as in Sketch #2, and a
moulding be added to take card of the appearance.
Then the beams can be put up without any sides,
(see Sketch $2).

Those with the lowering of the plaster
moulding now in place against the wall will give us
room just by the skin of its teeth.

After puzzling all day over the effect, I
have come to this conclusion; -- there is beauty and
charm in the indefinite, intangible thing, that leads
the imagination on -- and we had that the other night
with the gray beams and their soft shadows -- and
there is the beauty and interest in fine strong de
dinite and imaginative detail which this ceiling will
bring into the room. Perhaps the flatness forced by
conditions will make this large scale ceiling tie
into its surroundings as it would not with its origi-
-nal heavy deep beams and deep panels. In-any case
we have glimpsed one room and will have another ---
and it will be interesting to compare the effects.

Sunday I made the necessary drawings so
that Mr. Rossi could go ahead and put up one sec-
tion of the ceiling across the room, as a tryout,--
and will go back as soon as he has it up.

Yours very truly,
