Miss Julia Morgan, Architect.
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, Cal.

Dear Miss Morgan:-

I enclose a statement marked "A" of the lots contained in my fifth carload shipment, which are marked San Simeon for San Luis Obispo.

I also enclose list marked "B" of the articles in the same car, which are marked for Pleasanton, as it is possible that Mr. Hearst may wish to use some of these things at San Simeon instead of storing them at the Hacienda.

Sincerely,
s/ L J Oreilly
