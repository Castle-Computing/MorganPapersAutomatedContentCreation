Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Hearst Camp,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you for the shield suggestions.  I had just come from Mr. Van de Loo's where I had been trying to make him see a shield in character with the cornice detail.  The eagle idea carries the fantastic quality needed.  I will have several designs drawn in on the elevations for you to go over on Sunday.

You were right about the frieze -- it is too heavy for the room and for the scale of the bookcases.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
