Dear Mr.Hearst:

Mr.McCLure is going to be in Los Angeles this week end on some personal matter, and 
will bring you the Wyntoon base inventory from which the photostats are made, as 
showing the furniture at larger scale and with the pieces not in use marked.

I realize also that furniture in "The Bend" could be drawn on as the least fine are 
wonderful pieces.

If you would like me to follow up the changes in the Beach House furniture, I will 
do so gladly -- as it is something not easy to delegate on account of the variety of 
resources.

There is the possibility of gathering some lovely rooms by bringing together related 
pieces, a very light group in pear wood and painted wood or inlay -- as contrasted 
with a group very dark and rich in tone, etc.

Very truly yours,
JM:F
