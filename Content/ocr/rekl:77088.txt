Dear Mr. Joy:

There is considerable confusion and expense through variance in instructions, due to misunderstanding of purposes.  I want to suggest certain methods of procedure which will eliminate this confusion.

First, I would like very much to O.K. plans.  That means to sign them. Then if there are any departures from those plans I would greatly like to have the changes submitted and O.K.'d.

This will save unnecessary changes and reconstruction, or at least, if there are changes and reconstruction it will be entirely my doing.

Second, I think we should have a definite plan of procedure drawn up and O.K'd, with the special construction to be done in a given time specified and the order in which it is to be done stated, and all this O.K'd.

This method is in the manner of a general specification. It will give us all an idea of just what is to be done and how it is to be done and in what sequence it is to be done, and about how many men are to be employed and about how much it is going to cost.

Third, after the plans are drawn and O.K'd, and these general specifications are written and O.K'd, there cannot be any misunderstanding or complication.

I think these methods will simplify things for everybody.  Miss Morgan and I will be sure that we agree and know just what we agree on.

Mr. Rossi will know just what he has to do and how it is to be done.

And you can, by consulting the plans and the so-called specifications, see that everything is going ahead as agreed upon.

I would suggest, therefore, that we begin on this basis and that you draw up something of that kind loosely with regard to the work being done on the dressing rooms and the terrace and walls and stairs, etc., around the pool.

Mr. Joy-2

I would like this more as an example than anything else, because what is to be done there is I think sufficiently well understood and well under way.  We can then proceed similarly with the work on the south terrace and with any new work that is projected.

Sincerely,

W.R. Hearst
