Dear Mr. Hearst:

1. The Gumps report that the original statues of "Morning" and "Evening" are both 
destroyed.  They have one bronze copy of each about six (6) feet high including the 
rounded base.  The original figures were 14 ft. high. The figure of "Evening" on the 
table in your Social Room is about four feet high.

2.  We can obtain casts for the temple openings of just the right height, and enough 
of right width, to fill the recesses both toward the pool and toward the rocks -- so 
that should the trees die (Heaven forbid), the rear of the temple would have some 
interest.

If these suit you, enclosed also are the numbers of the casts suggested, from Caproni's
 catalogue, and the firm's Boston address.  As they make only plaster casts, we would
  have to make the stone castings on the Hill - using this to make moulds over.

3.  The Venetian furniture you wished used is in place in the Doges Suite and a good 
number of your new treasure are placed.

As always,

Yours truly,

Enc.
