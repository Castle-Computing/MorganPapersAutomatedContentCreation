Miss Julia Morgan,

San Francisco, Calif. 

Dear Miss Morgan:-
	
	Thank you very much for your recent telegram - which having arrived
while Mr. Cassou was out of town, was not acknowledged due 
to the fact that he contemplated returning shortly therfore, and 
would have preferred to give same his personal attention. 

	Insomuch as it now appearss that his return to the city may be delayed
for a week or even longer, I am writing to thank you, in behalf of 
Mr. Cassou, for your wire and whatever you have been good enough to 
accomplish in the ? referred to in his letter of May 5th. 

	You will doubtlessly hear from Mr. Cassou immediately upon his return
to New York. 

Very truly yours,
?
Secretary.
