Mr. William Randolph Hearst
137 Riverside Drive
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This morning I returned from San Simeon, where since the rain has held up, the principal activity, calling for the use of all trucks and men, has been the getting up of enough soil for your planting.  Enough is up now in the courts and along the main promenade.  On account of extra hard north winds and frosts, most of the plants sent up are being acclimatized in an improvised nursery.  Very few will die but a good many have lost their leaves.

The main work of the day was laying out and checking the new axis, as the men will be ready to start on the new terraces right away.

The possibility developed of leaving the little oak, and making the proposed pool the shape of the enclosed jotting, putting the Galatea at the head.  It would make quite a romantic touch, if the leaves from the oak did not make it impossible to keep the pool clean. You were correct in stating that the measure quoted in the telegram was wrong, 5 feet being copied instead of 3 feet.

The reason for not sending you drawings for the lower wall and pergola is because of not reaching a solution which seemed satisfactory. Yesterday on a path on the level of, and along the line of the proposed wall and pergola, with here and there incidental pergolas, would be more happy than the former idea, - with a simple rambling wall below, running up and down the hills, taking in some of the greenery below A, coming out below the lower terraces of both C and B, so on ultimately around the hill.  Would you think it a good plan to put in the walk, which would be a part of the wall and pergola scheme, or of the walk and pergola scheme, along the proposed line, and leave it in that stage until you see it?
As to the houses:- Van der Loo is working on the models for the ceiling of the living room of A. The painted friezes are up in the lobbies of A and B, and the painters are finishing the decorations and doors B and working on the ceilings of A. The reason of telegraphing you regarding C doors was because it did not seem as though Mr. Humrich had caught your idea, yet he though he had. On receipt of your telegram he changed them entirely and they promise very well.
The marble fountain in front of A is placed temporarily for your approval. It looks gay and pretty against the blue and white tile.
Could not you Persian tile be used in the backs of the Spanish seats about the semi-circle on the main terrace? They could also replace the tile now about the iron grille in front of House B? These being in, can stay until you see them.
The list from the Examiner Office and catalogues from New York are just received, and look most interesting.
In speaking of the name Mrs. Hearst has selected, attention was called yesterday to the fact that one of the original large old Spanish grants in the county is La Estrella, the ranch still bearing the name.
I hope the little model of B arrive safely. It does not look like a step-child now, does it?
Yours very truly,
