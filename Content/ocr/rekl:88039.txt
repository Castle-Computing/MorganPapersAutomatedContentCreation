Dear Miss Morgan:

Here are some things offered by Mr. Byne which I thought you might like-- the two 
pairs of wrought iron gates (nos. 5 and 30) especially.

The columns with escutcheons are unusual; the other things of minor importance, 
including two columns from the Arab period.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

NOTE: Chief will be at ranch tomorrow (Saturday) and remain there, I understand, 
until he goes to Wyntoon.- JW
