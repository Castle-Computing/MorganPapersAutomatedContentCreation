Dear Miss Morgan:

Answering your letter of June 6th, the plan most approved by you for Mr. Rossi is entirely satisfactory to me.

2. I hope the south terrace can also be finished in concrete.

3.  If we can get the railings up it would help a lot to give a finished appearance.

4. I hope we can put in the pavement over the new space added to the terrace in front of the big house, so that that will have a finished appearance.

Then I think we will be in fine shape by the Fourth of July;  However, lets do everything that we are doing in a permanent way and not do anything temporary and then have to redo it.  That takes so much time and expense.

I imagine of course the pool and the dressing rooms will be available for guests on and after July 4th.  Please make sure that all the plumbing fixtures and all the furnishings are installed, and oblige,

Yours very sincerely,

W.R. Hearst
