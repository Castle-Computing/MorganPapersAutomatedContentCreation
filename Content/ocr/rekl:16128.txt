Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Addison came -- is full of his subject, but modest and likable.  Seems as though he might be just right.  Before it rained we all (Mr. Rossi, Mr. Addison and self) went over the duck pond work - which is shaping up.  If you have no objection, will get the "gunite" people who coated the  Beach swimming pool, to come up and give a figure for shooting the concrete for these basins.  There is a good deal of it and put in in the usual way would take much of Mr. Rossi's time, quarry production, etc.

After thinking carefully, have asked Mr. Rossi to put the cutting off of the cupolas and carrying up of the main towers before all other work.  It will be impossible to keep scaffolds up once the winter winds start, and unless they are poured soon it will mean another season in disorder.  The low boxing and scoffolds of the Venetian patio are a comparatively simple matter.

The "party" Saturday, caught us again with a dismanteled Social Room, the choir stalls were being tried out.  One set is 12" higher than the other and 9" higher than the top of the old marble doorways.  There was not time to arrive at the solution and also have the room ready.

It seemed to a be a very appreciative party, and the day was very pretty until the rain came on in the evening.  Coming down that night we came upon very bad auto wreck and had to take the victims in to a San Luis hospital, one girl terribly crushed.  I was a harrowing night.

At the Beach House work was going well - the pool still tight.  Will Dutch tile (blue and white) be satisfactory for the kitchen, pantries, etc. between counter shelves and cupboards?  Most wall surfaces are covered by cases to ceiling.

Yours very truly,
