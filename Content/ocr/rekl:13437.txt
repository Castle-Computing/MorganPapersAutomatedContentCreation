Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I.  We have had quite a little rain, much to every ones relief -- although the gras is not up yet enough to cover last year's brown stubble.  The flower are lovely and the men, animals, etc. are in good shape.

ii.  In doubling the number of baths, we have not enough iron tables and mirrors to go around.  The two large ones too look rather "out of scale".  Will you send some or shallow use small wood tables?  The baths are completed.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
