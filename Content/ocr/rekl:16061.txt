Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.  In regard to the ceiling lights in the Gothic Study, we can get large square clear  lights used in your University work, or the ordinary round or square small sidewalk lights, also clear.  No amber shades are to be had in less than two to three months time.

2.  We are having the iron work made for the roof ties.

3. Do you want to go ahead with the elevators at this time?  If so, I will send down the contracts for your signature.

4.  I cabled "Belgium" on my return from San Simeon to send full specifications and terms of payment.

Yours very truly,

s/ JM
