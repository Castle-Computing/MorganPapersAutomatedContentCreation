Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Smith has been working since February 1st on new runs, subdivisions of pheasant 
pens, etc. at the poultry plant.  These bills amount to about $3600.00.  We have paid 
$600.00 on pay rolls from "budget" funds.  Did you mean these and the balance to be 
paid by the ranch as was done on the original units?

Yours very truly,
