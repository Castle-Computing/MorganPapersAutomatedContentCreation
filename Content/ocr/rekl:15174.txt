Dear Mr. Hearst:

The main cost of the chicken houses lies in the two ÒresidenceÓ sections.  These being really two very nice little houses - and taking nearly two thirds of the cost of the layout.  

I will make a development sketch of the canyon with the large pool you suggest.

Yours very truly,
