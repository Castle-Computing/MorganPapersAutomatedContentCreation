Dear Mr. Hearst:

The marble walls, etc. for the Doges Suite are being made and will all be in place by the first of May.  There remains yet to order the wash basins.  Made of the darker "rosata" marble, basins integral with the slab like in your House A rooms, they will cost $1120.00 each, the legs as shown in the enclosed cut, or duplicating those in House A.

If new models are made for the legs or standards it will considerably increase the cost.

Marble slabs with porcelain bowls would be much less expensive than the one piece bowls.

Do you wish curtains or doors for the showers?  If doors, see enclosed cuts and prices.

The Doges Suite rooms are taking shape nicely, the only worry being the sitting room wall covering.  The pieces sent by French & Co. do not match in pattern, lengths, etc.  I have asked them to send all they have of the material in hopes of getting enough of one pattern.  The color is fine - and it will quite break my heart if it cannot be made to work out.

Yours very truly,
