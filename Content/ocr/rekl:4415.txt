Dear Miss Morgan:

I telegraphed you to-day:

"Better wait for settled weather and build towers of concrete.  Meanwhile, put decorators in house A instead of C so that construction will not injure decoration; that is, if you think best.
	
"How are the other houses proceeding?  Can you send me models of A and B similar to model of C?  These are very illuminating.

"What do you think of central motif for the middle plot or plaza?  How about a fountain or a pool?  The water could run from that into the fountains of the various houses as these would be lower down.

"I think since everything else has been so elaborated and refined we should do something particularly attractive in this central plot."

The solution of the central plot is simple enough on paper but I do not know how it will work out on the ground.

I suggest, if the practical situation permits, that we change the axis of the main house and aim it directly at the middle of the central plot, and that we put a fountain and a pool in the middle of the plot in a way to make a very decorative feature for the terrace of the main house to look out upon.

In fact, I imagine that the terrace of the main house could be made to merge right into  this central motif so that this central plot or plaza would be the front yard of the main house, as it were.  In order to do this successfully we would have to move one tree and maybe tow, but this, I understand, can be done, especially as these trees are not, as I remember, the very big ones.

I think the axis of the main house could be swung around in the manner indicated, but it might be necessary to advance it a little bit, so that it would be clear the big trees on each side of the main house.  I will not attempt to say how this should be done, as you can tell much better on the ground/

2. I have telegraphed about the towers on house C.  I think the towers are very attractive and will have considerable practical value in addition to beauty.  They should be wonderful sleeping porches and if there is room we should have a wash stand in each one of those upper tower rooms but not much else.

3. I wrote also about a turn for automobiles on the right hand side of the main house just before the road enters the circle around the central plot.  I spoke about this before and it seems to me rather desirable, because we are making the road around the central plot more and more of a park and promenade and less of a road than we had originally intended, and the passage of any considerable number of automobiles around this path will certainly be a nuisance if not a menace.
It ought to be possible for most of the automobiles which arrive to deliver their passengers and luggage or whatever they have to deliver at the first turn, the proposed one, and then retreat without disturbing the inhabitants of the houses at all.  Please try to work something out on these lines.

4.  The model of house C which you sent me is very charming and very informative.  It gives me a complete idea of the little house and its gardens.  I would very much like to have a similar model of house A, which I think should be a very effective house, with its terraces.

I do not see that there is anything else to be done to House A but it will be hard to make the terraces as pretty as those of house C.   Everything that we can do, however, should be done to make it equally attractive.

House B is the stepchild at present, and nothing has been done to make its terraces especially attractive.  I wish you would kindly devise something so that it may be in line with the others and have a little private garden that will be beautiful.

5. I am sending another car containing various purchases.  There are two Hermes, ancient Greek heads, the archaic style, from Lord Hope's collection.  I think they should go as decoration in the court of house A, perhaps where I have drawn the little circles.

I also got an oriental lattice which we can use as a model perhaps for the lattices in the towers.

I also bought a so-called sarcophagus but which the Metropolitan Museum people tell me is not a sarcophagus but in all probability a cistern or basin of a wall fountain, presumably made for some monastery.

The piece was sold as Byzantine and I am disposed to think is Byzantine.  The Metropolitan Museum does not dispute it,  but say there are some arguments in favor of 10th or 11th century.  I will enclose their letter, which please be good enough to return to me after you have read it.

This very interesting piece, I think, we can place in the middle of the court wall of house C, right under where we now have the little terra cotta virgin and child.


I was fortunate enough to get at this same sale a very wonderful Persian 16th century tile field.  It is almost 4' X 5' in size and is similar to one of the prized pieces of the Metropolitan Museum.  It is said to come from the imperial summer palace.  You will admire it greatly, I am sure, and I suggest that we take out the little field in there with a little tile frame or gilt frame of some kind.

I do not know whether to protect it with glass or not.  I would like to, but glass somehow does not look right over an outside decorations of this kind.  

6. I have been unable to get any Spanish jars or even any Moorish jars of any consequence, but I have secured a number of good Chinese jars and jardinieres which we ought to be able to use effectively in important points of out garden decoration.  I am having these carefully packed and put in the car.

I also got some very fine Chinese stone statuary and some very rare wood carvings.  I am sending these along, too, although I do not know where to use them, for the moment.  They are too good to put outside.  We can probably use them later in one of the houses which we will build in  Chinese style.

7.  There is a sale of 16th century Italian stuff coming off in a week or so, and after that I think I will have a car full and about all that is important, as the good sales of the year will then be over.

I am getting some chairs and practical furniture for use inside the houses.

You will notice among the marbles I sent out a little while ago a very beautiful Galtea, which we could possibly use in the central pool that I am suggesting.   There is also, I think, a tinted statue by Gerome, which might be put in the Byzantine story of house A.  This latter should certainly be protected.

If you will send me plans and elevations for the Byzantine suite I will try to get some material for it here.

Sincerely yours,
