October 15, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
c/o Lost Angeles Examiner,
Los Angeles, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

My last vacation was the trip to Honolulu in 1920 -- and I am repeating it for the same clients.  I had hoped to see you before leaving.

The memorial drawings are practically done, and a set ready for you.  Dr. Campbell and Mr. Fleishhacker each have a set.

I went over the dairy and barn sites with Mr. Lee and Mr. Rossi and have left in the office for you horse barns and a possible suggestion for gathering together the farm machinery, black smithy, trucks, implements, supplies, etc. in one group.  Also chicken house plans, etc.

I will come straight back by the same boat and hope you will be here.  Everyone has plenty of instructions, drawings, etc. to keep them busy and the office is at your service always.

Thanking you for your very many kindnesses,

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan
