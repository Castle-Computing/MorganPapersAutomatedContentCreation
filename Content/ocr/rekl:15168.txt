Dear Miss Morgan:

I wonder if we cannot find a Spanish-Moorish ceiling for the refectory at San Simeon.  It seems a shame not to put genuine ceilings everywhere in this big house.

I am sure that the painted ceiling we contemplate is going to be effective, but it will weaken the effect of the series of old ceilings we now have.

I always thought of this room in terms of a Gothic ceiling when I was hunting for some old ceiling to put in there, but Gothic ceilings are so few we can hardly hope to find the right size;  but we can fine it in Spanish ceilings, I think.

We have one ceiling one hundred feet long.  This could be cut down, but I hate to sacrifice any part of it;  but surely some Spanish-Moorish ceiling can be discovered which will fit this seventy-foot room.

Please cable Byne to look out for such a one.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
