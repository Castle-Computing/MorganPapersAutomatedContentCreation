Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday at San Simeon we ran the lines for the lower Esplanade roughly from the lower C to the main cross axe.  The trenching was being done below C -- but I asked Mr. Rossi and Mr. Keep to work together to try to save the pleached trees -- to box them just as any other tree would be boxed to be moved, instead of taking up by bare roots usual orchard fashion.  In the mean time the men are getting the whole from C to cross axe cutline in according to the drawings - for any needed adjustments to correct perspective effects of the curves.

We have a new possible solution of the tower cupola, am anxious to have your eye on.

There is a large force on the Tennis Court.

Am I to plan on another month large allowance?  We have put the labor before the material for the past two months and have to meet steel, marble, stone, plumbing and other material bills the first of the month.  It is so easy this weather to run too far ahead of budget.

The animals arrived in beautiful shape.  I had to rub my eyes last night when out of the semi darkness staring at the lights were grouped three ostriches, five zebras, five white deer two with big horns, a llama, and some speckled deer.  All in a group!  the giraffes are a beautiful specimen.

Yours very truly,
