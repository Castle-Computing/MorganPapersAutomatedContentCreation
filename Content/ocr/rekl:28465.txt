Dear Mr. Hearst:

Work on the Hill has been kept to program pretty well.  The marble men on  completing the pool were kept to put down the Cloister gallery and Gothic suite floors which will all be done by the first of July. You can more than see the bottom of the pool.

The stone facing so far as up looks finely -- this is a real piece of work and of course could not be completed this month, but will be enough so to be effective.

The Gothic Suite is well along.  In House A all you asked to have done will be completed except some bits of hardware not yet received from the East.

The Tennis Court bank had a cave in one night recently which was discouraging, but work there is being pushed as much as possible.

We splurged heavily on labor, steel, marble, and materials generally all the month.  This is written, in case you do not come home by the time this reaches you, to ask how much we can spend in July on bills and work so as to tell how many men to have come back after the 4th of July let-down.

Yours very truly,
