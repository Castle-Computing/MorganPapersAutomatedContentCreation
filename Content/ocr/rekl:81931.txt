My dear Miss Morgan:

Miss Davies wants to improve the Beverly Hills house.  She does not want to reconstruct 
it the way we had originally planned but she wants to add to it and get some of the 
benefits of the former plan at a moderate cost.  The idea in a general way is this:

First, to extend the living room and make a room beyond it, which may be the music room 
or something of that kind.

Second, to extend the dining room in the same direction and make a library.  The library
 would open into the music room and into the living room.

Third, to build above these rooms fine, large bed rooms and to make an over-hang in an 
early English style of the upper story, so that there would be plenty of width to enable 
us to have fine large bed rooms.  We will also have a bath and a dressing room with 
each bed room if possible.  In fact we want a luxurious establishment.

Towards the other side we think the kitchen, pantry, screen porch etcetera, should be 
extended in a similar manner and over these there should be more bed rooms. Perhaps you 
can get four more bed rooms in on the side, making eight in all.

Then we would like to take the garage and move it down where we had intended to put the 
garage on the expensive scheme, but of course making the construction as cheap as 
possible.

I would also like to extend the gardens in the same way that we had intended on the 
expensive scheme and to put the swimming pool in the garden just as we had planned on 
the expensive scheme.  In fact the garden layout to be exactly similar and the garage 
layout to be similar except for cheapness of construction.

We could then finish the steps down to the terrace courts and complete the terrace.

Mr. Joy is familiar with the plans we had before and perhaps he would be the one to 
make the plans for the reconstruction.  Miss Davies feels she has got to abandon the 
idea of having a big expensive house there, because in all probability she will sell 
the property, but she does want a layout which will be very attractive and enable her 
tot a big price for the property.

Can Mr. Joy run and see Miss Davies and Mr. Hellenthal about this?

Sincerely yours,
