Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Hearst Camp,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This is to acknowledge from you a check for three thousand dollars which we are sending today to Mr. Arthur Byne, Monte Esquinza, 6, Madrid, Spain, asking him to cover the forfeited deposit on the small Andalusian house and the cost of this building if still obtainable.  I am also asking him to send a list and photographs of available ceilings, window and door trims, etc. rather than lists and photographs of furniture and minor objects such as Tolentino has.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
