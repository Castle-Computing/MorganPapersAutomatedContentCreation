November 29, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I have been working over our five months programs carrying it out in more detail and would like to go over it with you that you may see just what it entails in labor and money.  Mr. Rossi has worked with me and Mr. Le Feaver has prepared the estimates of costs so that I think you will find it a pretty close approcimation.

I shall be in Los Angeles on Wednesday and if necessary on Thursday this week.  Would it be possible to see you on either of those days.  If so will you please wire?

Yours very truly,

s/ Thaddeus Joy
