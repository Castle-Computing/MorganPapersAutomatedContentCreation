Dear Mr.Hearst:

Anything at all that I can do personally, or attend to personally, I will be only 
too happy to do, as always.

However, there is with me in my small way, as with you in your large on, a necessity 
of keeping track of expenses.

It might be well to say that you have been asked to pay for no unexecuted work for 
many years back, in fact before we made the working drawings for Mount Olive at Wyntoon.  
You realize thinking back the many projects we have developed together, that I could 
have had no profit in these years and I have not wanted it.

As regards Mr.McClure -- on my return this Spring he told me that he wished to remain 
with the office but would like an arrangement allowing him to come to go at our 
convenience so that he could try out his shop experiment.  I know him well enough 
to realize that he doe snot like too long confinement to our city office and so 
use him on outside work as is possible.

Very truly yours,
JM:F
