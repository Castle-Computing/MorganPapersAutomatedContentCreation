Dear Mac.

In giving you list of yardage good, forgot to mention the blue brocade material in the 
basement chest nearest the entrance,which was bought some years ago with eh idea of 
making a set for Miss Davies' bed.  Better get it out.   I think that covers all the 
"material" except the antique wall hangings.

Am sorry, but it is not possible to quote ahead with any sureness on remodeling.  
Each change Mr.Hears inquires the cost of, seems to require practically all trades -- 
for instance, the Morning Room --

1.  Concrete driller and labor.  Skillful concrete drill man to remove the walls 
behind fireplace, and the chimney over the men's dressing room and the various walls, 
also to cut new door under Billiard Room stair to men's toilet.

2.  Plumber to remove plumbing fixtures lines and fixtures.

3.  Carpenters to take out ceiling of men's room, doors, joists, studs, etc. and to 
reframe for and put up new panel of East room ceiling.

4.  Stone masons to take down the mantel and the two doorways and take up the three 
little marble floors and fill in toilet room door.

5.  Electrician to take out present wiring and rewire.

6.  Plasterer to replaster new section and patch at new toilet door.

7.  Millwork and carving down below to furnish the new section of ceiling.

8.  Carpenters to put up above.

9.  Marble work down below to furnish material for new section of floor to match that 
of Morning Room.

10.  Marble man to set the above.

11.  Painter New ceiling panel walls and retouching.

12.  A man in charge to coordinate all the above.

We will have to pay the same transportation and time lost for their short stay as we 
would for the whole season.
