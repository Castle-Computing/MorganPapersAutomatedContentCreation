Dear Miss Morgan:

I think these bosses would be marvelous as supports for the four chandeliers in the 
great hall which we are proposing to build.

They are not Gothic - they are Renaissance - but the hall I should say is transitional.

If you agree with me, will you please send the following telegram:

"Byne, Accept goldbosses eighteen hundred.  Hearst."

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
