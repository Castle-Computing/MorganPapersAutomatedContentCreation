My dear Miss Morgan:

Here are a lot of shields treated differently from the shields on our frieze, which we find rather heavy, I think part of the heaviness is due to the swag - or whatever you call it - which is heavy, and part to the particularly square character of the shield.  In these sheets enclosed clever use is made of the eagle with he shield as a chest protector.  Please note the doorway of Casa Polintinus on Plate 18, also a little different eagle on Plate 16.  Perhaps an eagle would help us out.  Then on Plate 16 there is a little different treatment of the scroll of fruit and flowers, which does not go all way around the shield.  On top of the shield is a bowknot.  On plate 15 the swag comes from back of the shield and is very much lighter.  This also seems a good treatment to accomplish what we want.

On plate 17 - Elevation of Casa Polentina - there are various manners of framing the shield.  the eagle appears again,also shield with crest and conventionalized dolphins.

I thought you might like these various suggestions.

Then instead of the balustrade there are scrolls and heads as in Plate 17 - Scrolls and putti plate 15 - Griffins and such Plate 16.  Perhaps it is the balustrade which makes the effect heavy although I don't quite think so,

I am sending you also the measurements of the Dandolo Cornice.  The cornice is fine but it is 4 ft. deep.  That is tremendously big for a 14-foot room.  Perhaps we can leave of the lower member which is 1 ft. 1 in. in depth.

Very sincerely yours,
