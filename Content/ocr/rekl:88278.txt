Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclsoed is a plot of the "old Bridge building site with location of heater room, 
bulk-head walls, etc.  If the heating plant goes into the basement made for it, some 
roofed structure will have to go either alongside or over it to make reasonable the 
chimney for the plant.

I would have answere das to the fountain, but saw it required a picturesque solution 
of the whole abandoned area.

We encountered very bad foundation conditions on the new site for the Bridge House, 
which has made its progress slow -- great, loose boulders below a deep, soft fill.  
The concrete will be in very soon now.

The Tea House is progressing well, the masons working on the main story walls.

The Chalet changes are made, and the interior finish of the rooms is begun.

Mr. Pogany and four aides arrived Thursady and are experimenting on the "oriel" over 
the Brown Bear doorway.  Mr. Pogany wants a very smooth plaster working surface.

At Jolon, The steel posts and girders are in place, new openings cut, etc., and the 
work going along well.

At San Simeon, George has been making good headway on the taking down of the porch
 over his office, small stair, etc., and is getting ready to pour the little addition 
 on the roof over the theatre.

I had a suspicion all was not as it should be in the theatre, and asked Mr. Wililams 
to work with Mrs. Redelsperger, taking everything out, and carpets up.  The moths 
had made considerable headway with the carpet, but fortunately had not touched the 
hangings.  It is quite a bit of work, but was necessary, and did not require extra 
help.

The lower esplanade looks better for every week's progress.Page #2 Mr. Hearst Aug. 5, 1936

At Santa Monica, on receiving your letter we started investigations as to the life 
of linoleum laid on a wood underfloor -- and so far the reports are not favorable -- 
on account of the various contractions and expansions involved.

Working drawings are ready for the Great Library, and Help's House over the store 
room.

I am just back from San Simeon, so cannot go over the New York warehouse furniture 
books until next week.  We have out here many beds -- are shy of bureaus and chairs.  
If you have any in reserve, they would be most welcome.  (I always remember in asking 
such items, the young boy who asked you for four nice Gothic statues for the 
Refectory).

As always,

Yours very truly,

Enc.
