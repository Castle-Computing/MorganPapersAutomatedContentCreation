Dear Miss Morgan:

I am pleased to know that you are still interested in the lovely old Eagle lanterns.

As you know, these lanterns are priced at $8000.00 for the pair, but if you want them 
I will let you have them for $6000.00.

These old lanterns are my "pets", and if you should use them, I would feel that it 
would be equal to placing them in some lovely museum.

Mrs. Huntington had planned to buy them for her son for the Hispanic Society, but 
she died before the deal was closed.

Hoping to hear from you soon,

Sincerely yours,
