Mr. Arthur Byne
The St. Regis
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Byne:

It is always hopeless to get a photograph back from Mr. Hearst and for that reason had 
your photograph copied for our files & so fortunately can send you our copy of the 
grille.  They keep no files for Mr. Hearst personally, and as he moves about much, I 
suppose his secretaries become desparate.

The grille did not make an impression on Mr. Hearst as he has several about 18' to 21'
 which seem to be more interesting.

Possibly I may be in New York the first week in January -- not at all sure, - but maybe 
Mr. Hearst by that time will be on his way back.  The best plan will be to see him here 
where he has relative leisure and undivided interest.

Best wishes to you and to Mildred.

Sincerely yours,
