Dear Mr. Murray:

	We have never figured out how
much the valuation is of the few items build in
at Wyntoon - mainly mantols and a few fountains.

	At San Simeon, however, we made
a list of "Articles as Incorporated in La Cuesta
Encantada Group" as of December 1937, the total
of which was reported to you as $ 1,006,205.86.
on December 31, 1937. The detailed list (39 sheets)
was sent you with a letter on December 31, 1937.

Very truly yours,
