I DO NOT THINK THE TWO CURVED FLIGHTS OF STEPS AROUND THE POOL WEST OF HOUSE C SHOULD TERMINATE IN THE WIDE STEPS AS IN PLAN THIS LEAVES YOU NOWHERE AND COMPELS YOU TO WALK UP FOUR STEPS TO GET TO THE LEVEL OF THE POOL OR EVEN TO DESCEND THE LAST CENTRAL FLIGHT OF STEPS THESE CURVED STEPS SHOULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO THE PLATFORM OF THE POOL OR TO A TERRACE ON THE SAME LEVEL WITH POOL PLATFORM
