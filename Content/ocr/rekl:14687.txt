Dear Mr. Hearst:

A man and wife have at length turned up who seem possible - as houseman, etc.  Mr. Fairchild heard of them and put us on their trail.  They have run tourist hotels in Teneriffee, Spain, a country estate in Scotland, also a country club near Pittsburg for some years, and are both evidently of the better type servant class.  I think they would know how to take care of both houses and guests.  The chief drawback is that the man is of very small size - he and his wife of equal height, - which does not give him an impressive major-domo appearance.  They say they are willing to really work, and would like the place on account of the opportunity it offers them to "save up".  They have two boys twelve and fourteen years old who would be disposed of at a boarding school, I imagine.

The man is of Germanic extraction, brought up in England, - the wife English. They together want $200.00 a month to start on, and are the best possibilities so far.

Yours very truly,
