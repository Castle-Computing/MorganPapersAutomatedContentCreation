Dear Mr. Hearst:

On the Hill Tuesday I found the Celestial ceiling really advanced, and handsome.  
Mr. Solon's design is being carried out by Mr. Gyorgy's men.

Another full crew (six men) has been put on the Roman pool and I left Mr. Solon with 
very well arighted ideas so that I do not think he will have the impulse to undo 
anything this week.

Mr. Loorz is pouring the concrete indoor stairs on the east side and will continue 
on with the concrete walls of the shower rooms on this side.

Your suggestion as to ceiling panel led to a small inspiration that may make the 
lower North Duplex much pleasanter, and as it involved little expense, have ventured 
on it.

The new mantels have given a fine solution for the South Lower Duplex, - they give us 
lots to work with.  I've been quite overwhelmed with the possibilities of these last 
carloads.

Personally, am still a turbaned Turk for some obscure reason, but have lots more 
strength, and energy.

Yours truly,

 I have not hurt Mr Solons feelings.
