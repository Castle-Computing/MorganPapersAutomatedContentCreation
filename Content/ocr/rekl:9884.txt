Dear Miss Morgan :

Mr. Hearst was selecting to-day from a batch of photographs the list of things to go West in next shipment.  Among them were the enclosed four items, marked on the back a, b, c, and d.  Mr. Hearst instructed me to give you the following messages regarding each one :

(a)  "I think these are very quaint and they ought to be used effectively in the architecture of the main house and perhaps in the same manner in which we used the little lions and columns on house C."

(b)  "Here is a very quaint and interesting old cupboard.  It is obviously incomplete, there having been at one time some top to it.  But I thought we might use it by building it into the wall in the refectory room and getting a good effect out of it and some use out of it, too."

(c)  "Here is a handsome wrought iron well-head.  I do not know whether you would want to use it as a well-head-- we have quite a number of stone wells.  But it would certainly be effective as an embellishment somewhere.  I think it is good enough also to have some protection from the weather."

(d)  "These, like the columns resting on the animals, might be used architecturally in the main house."

Sincerely,
s/
