Dear Miss Morgan:

In comparing our place here with the Italian villas I find that the main advantage the Italian villas have over us are in the mater of wide terraces.

Our walks and terraces are generally narrow and not formal, the Esplanade being the one notable exception.  We have practically no large terrace areas in the nature of plazas except the one in front of the main house.  Of course we will have another at the east end of the main house when we construct the patio, but I think the whole grounds would assume a more formal and finished aspect if we transformed our walks into formal Esplanades and paved them with tiles and bordered them more or less rigidly with vases or railings or statuary, etc.

The two terraces on either side of the pool and the flights of steps leading down are going to be attractive features.  I suggest we make these terraces as big as possible and the steps as wide and stately as possible.

All these things on a big scale will help to conform the landscape to the scale of the main house and in addition they will make the grounds much more livable as well as much more stately.

I would like to go over the grounds with you to see where these esplanades and terraces can be made.  I think the pomegranate walk should be widened to about the width of our present esplanade and I think another esplanade should be inserted in the landscape, possibly by widening the present walk which goes partly around the hill and joins up with the terraces in front of the houses.

I think there should be some very wide terraces below the present wall on the west and south sides particularly.  The road rather prevents anything of that kind on the north side.  However, effective terraces can be put in front of the new north house, which we can call House D or Casa del Canyon for identification.

The wide terraces below the present wall can be approached by very imposing flights of steps on the order of the steps below the pool.  Particularly can features of this kind be built in front of House A and C, and probably in front of House E, which will be the new house on the south side.

I should think two such lower esplanades and terraces could be built before we come to the final lower wall, which we have vaguely planned, and which would be an esplanade covered with a wide pergola bearing grape vines.

I think there should be fountains and various features, such as columns and statuary to emphasize the important points on the new terraces and stairways, and that there should be temples and towers and pools at various viewpoints and pleasant places.

I donÕt see why we canÕt build something conspicuous and useful and attractive too in the middle of the blank space to the west that we always feel needs filling up.  I mean the space west of the pool in the middle of that stretch of lower wall.

Perhaps we might have a temple here, or an Alhambra tower, or a Moorish pavillon, or Chinese tea garden, or something that would be effective and enjoyable.

I would also suggest that we put columns or some feature on each side of the cascade terminating the esplanade where it turns and goes up back of the Neptune fountain.

We can walk over the grounds and plan out these things.  I am merely making these notes as reminders.

Sincerely yours,
