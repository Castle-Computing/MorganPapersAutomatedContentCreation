Dear Miss Morgan:

I have your note about not liking the bookcases dividing the library alcoves. I wired you not to do this or anything else that you do not wholly approve of.  I make a lot of suggestions and if any of them are impracticable or imperfect from an architectural point of view, please discard them and substitute whatever you think is better.

The idea back of this suggestion of mine was to make some sort of a line to indicate that these alcoves were in a way separate from the sitting room,  which runs at right angles to them.

I thought of putting two small columns on top of the bookcase to  reach to the ceiling.  Perhaps it would be better to have larger columns instead of the cases, or two have a column on each side near the wall, just to sort of indicate that there was a separation here.  I suppose in this way the east and west ends with the fireplaces will show up better.

I bought about eighty-five yards of old red velvet that I thought we might use in this sitting room with its alcoves; or, if that is too little for this room, we could use it in the sitting room on the second floor int he rear of the big central house.

Perhaps with the screen, however, and the fireplaces and the windows, and some built-in bookcases along the walls, the 85 yards of velvet will do.  But it seems to me very little, as it is only a foot and a half wide.

I suppose you have the books and pictures I sent by this time.  I am trying to find things that will make these little houses interesting and distinct even, not at all like the ordinary bungalows.

I have sent a lot of marble columns, most of which you can use on these little houses.  But there are four black ones that I think we can use in the upper front of the big house;  and perhaps some others should be reserved for the big houses.

I do not suppose you want more than two columns, or at the most four columns, for each one of the little houses.

I hope you will see your way to work in those carved and colored cornices in the Moorish style, and to use some tiling for the frieze and perhaps in other places where if will be effective.  I think this will take the cottages away from the bungalow look, and give them a character which is perfectly appropriate, as many of the buildings of Southern Spain have this motif in their architecture.
