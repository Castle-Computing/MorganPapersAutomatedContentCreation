Dear Mr. Hearst:

It was intended the day of your visit to show you the seed box houses.  The gardeners estimate there are more than 35,000 seedling plants coming along, covering almost all the annuals you mention.  It is not expected that all the plants will survive, but enough to make a fair showing.   The problem will be water and soil and enough when the hot days come.  It looks as though it were best to use the trucks and water just now for the new concrete of the various projects rather than putting this work off in order to move dirt.  They are using the "juicy morsels" (mixtures of rock and dirt such as you called my attention to) for lower flower bed spaces with some dirt on top.  Gradually this earth can be made richer with material from below.  The gardeners report an extra heavy frost one morning this week which did some damage.  I am thinking it will be wise to keep your best bouganvillas and palms in the boxes this year and move them into the hot houses for next winter or until they are acclimated.  The natural place for hot houses seem to be over toward the garbage location, but the gardeners are against it, - say it is cold and windy there, and want them located below the stony field (Van der Loo's last year's cast stone yard) - which would not do.  What would you suggest.

The door of the lower terrace of A is done and I think well, but it is an extra large door, much too large for B.  We can make a new door if you wish for B and use the present one some place later, where it will not show.  The door of A can open out, and the space between the old and the new walls be utilized for storing terrace furniture in winter should you decide to keep the door where it is.  I am enclosing a plan of the lower A terraces.  Below C, the little pool is just a Moorish basin, in the pavement, with a water jet, the pool lined with turquoise blue.  By contrast, how would a real fountain look below A where shown? It would be seen from the windows of A's library as well as from lower levels.  There are one or more fountains in the last shipment but I have no clew as yet to their nature as there is no space in  the warehouse to open up a whole set of cases (such as seven or eight parts of fountains)  in.  About the finish of this lower work: shall it be left semi-rough or plastered like walls above?  It could be colored the same if left rough and save plastering expense.
Returning to gardens;-  I am glad with you not to have to depend on the rare things of Mulhall's lists for this year's results and have provided Dailey (Gardiner - singular) with order to ferret out the flowers on your lists not already in the way.  I am wondering if the yellow flowers in your grandmother's garden were not four-o'clocks, In any case will try to find them.

Yours very truly,
