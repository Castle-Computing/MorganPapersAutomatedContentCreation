Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The new method of handling the bills is a great improvement and is paying already in better service.  Personally I am glad, as the accumulating arrears was tieing up too large a proportion of my working funds.  It is in regard to this back condition I am writing -- on Mr. Bogart's suggestion -- to know whether you meant for him to gradually pay off the arrears in lump sums as convenient to him, or whether you meant to have me pay it off out of the monthly allowance at so much per month until paid.

Either way is satisfactory to me.

In spite of the expensive type of draughting required, costs in the office, buying, handling, etc. have worked out just about as I told you they were doing, some months costing 6 1/2%, some even 8% of the months bills, but on the whole leaving an average profit of 1% to 1 1/2% clear -- which under the conditions is perfectly satisfactory to me.  Of the amount due one-third represents profits and two-thirds tied up working funds.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
