October 23, 1926

My Dear Mr. Hearst:

On October 15th Miss Morgan was stricken with a serious intestinal illness which necessitated an immediate operation.  She was in a dangerous condition until yesterday, but she is now able to take food and her physician reports that her condition has turned toward recovery.

She will be confined for several weeks.

Yesterday she showed her renewed interest in life by asking if any damage had been done by the earthquake at San Simeon.

I know you will add your hope to ours.

I shall be at San Simeon on the 27th and shall have something to report on the telephone matter then and will also send you a report of how work is progressing.

Mr. Nusbaum visited the Santa Monica job last Monday.

Yours very truly,

Thaddeus Joy
