Dear Mr. Neylan:

	Last Sunday, in talking budget with Mr. 
Hearst, I told him that if could proceed at about
the rate we are now going, and he could allow us
$25,000.00 a month for the season, we could handle
the outstanding accounts without any large down-right
sum at this time as most of the people will be satisfied
with small payments, if regular.

	Many of the accounts listed as previous
to March, 1932, are very old ones, due to material
having been ordered for work which was to have been 
carried on to a finish, but which could not be -
and can not yet be,- on account of altered plans.

	There is no work or material on the 
list which Mr. Hearst did not order done, the current
routine expenses of course not ever being taken up in
detail.

	There is $11,000.00 yet due this account
on this year's budget, which accounts for not having 
our smaller routine bills in better shape. The only
firms complaining are those to whom we promised small
regular payments which we have not been able to meet. 

	We are much behind on payments of our
own commission as we can not draw for ourselves under
the circumstances. 
	
	Any further information we will be glad
to furnish. 
	
	Yours truly,
