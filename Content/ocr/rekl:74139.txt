Dear Mr. Hearst:

You said to remind you toward the end of the month if more funds were needed to keep the work moving as it should.  We have saved out of the Budget Fund enough to carry the payrolls, but need badly to pay up the Musto Keenan marble floor bill which was contracted last summer in order to get the new Colorado Travertine for the stair ways.  The bill amounts to $6460.00.

Yours very truly,
