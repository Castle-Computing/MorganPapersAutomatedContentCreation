March 2, 1930

Dear Miss Morgan:

I would like to see the Egyptian statues mounted and lights installed on south feature 
of plaza.

What do you think of large alabaster bowls on top of columns?

We might also move the statue of the woman and infant to the middle of the south terrace.

I think these things would make this section look finished.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan
