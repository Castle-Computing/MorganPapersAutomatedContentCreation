Dear Mr. Hearst:

Am sorry you had cause to weep.  The gardener is very literal and very anxious to do as you want.  When I discovered the heliotrope disaster, he explained that you had said to keep heliotrope to borders only so he was taking it out everywhere else!  I had him put right back in small hardy plants that by fall should be quite perceptable.  Will see to the thinning out of the pink geranium.

I liked and enjoyed very much the movey people.  They are artists, and alive.  It was a pleasure also to see the way those who did not go swimming went around absorbedly talking in detail. - To tell the truth, I was quite thrilled myself.

I am going up Friday night to work out various details which need passing on to people there, and will be most glad to have the day there with you any time.  There are many details to go over, that do not seem fair to bring up when people all want you.  It was a beautiful party.

Yours very truly,
