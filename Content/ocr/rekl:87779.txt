Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, California

March 25, 1934.

Dear Miss Morgan:

It would help greatly if you could send to Mr. Williams the photographs of objects 
sent out to the ranch by McGregor, so that he may show them to me together with the 
list that you send him.  The photographs can be returned to you after I see them.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco.

P-S  Mr. Williams will send you some drawings by Henry Clive-- originals of first 
pages of the American Weekly.  Mr. Hearst asks if you will kindly have them 
appropriately framed for use at Wyntoon.  Thank you.

s/ J Willicombe
