March 1, 1927.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst
Ambassador hotel,
Los Angeles, California.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
Mr. Joy will bring down to you the revised temple area model, complete now, as soon as the supplimentary model you suggest in your last letter can be made. He can also bring the suggestive detail for the colonnade itself.
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
