Dear Mr. Hearst:

The installing of the 'house and grounds' telephone system was finished yesterday, and seems to be a fine piece of work -- with plenty of leeway for future extensions.  Work is progressing on the transformers which we expect will be completed by the holidays -- when all the house heaters can be operated.

The roads are in fine shape and the work of leveling the Grande Place and road to the foot of the steps from it is progressing and if weather does not change, will all be done by the end of the coming week.  The larger gymnasium pool is being literally carved out of solid rock and the work is necessarily slow as we cannot blast.

It will cost about $2500.00 to pipe and heat the waters in the three pools (as one), with temporarily installed 'plant' down the Hill as per telegram -- otherwise, this amount of work, of pipe, the heater, etc. would be lost in changing to the better and permanent system of heating from the central boiler.  If the 'office' building off the esplanade below the kitchen could be put in this next spring or summer, - in the rough at least, - and the boiler be set there, it would care for the main building, future houses 'D' and 'E', the recreation building and plunges and the office building itself, very economically.  Houses 'A', 'B' and 'C' with the electrics and fireplaces, seem to be pretty well taken care of.

The pouring of the service wing is progressing very well - and after Christmas we can get sash in and finish quickly enough rooms to house the women employees.  This will greatly relieve the housing situation.

Yesterday, with few exceptions I 'visited' with practically all the older inhabitants and things

seem to be gong well.  Mr. Slattery is winning confidence and gradually forming opinions which as far as divulged, seem reasonable and progressive.  Mr. Rossi is so busy he is comparitively happy.  The oak trees are engrossing, for one thing - (and make the place terribly untidy.)

The plan is to close down so far as possible from Friday, the 23rd, to January 3rd.  Then to run to the extent you may decide.  The wooden buildings will hold about 60 - 65 men. Trying to work more men through the rainy months is not economical and the colds and bad feeling due to housing the men in camp construction basements, etc. is not good in its effects on the camp morale.  Also, the lull would allow catching up with back bills a bit as we have run steadily beyond our budget this summer and fall.

The Gothic lobby is approaching a finish, and is more effective than it promised to be.  That suite quite reaches me.  As you look form the Hogback and see the new wing, the value of the added roof over the Gothic study is very apparent.

The forms for the lower tower stories of the 'Dove-cotes' are up and the effect is remarkable, that is, the way it makes 'the building', a great building crowning a hill.

This is rather long, but I put in a long day.

As always

Yours very truly,
