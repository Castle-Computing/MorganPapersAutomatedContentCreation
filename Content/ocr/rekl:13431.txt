Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive, 
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I. In order to enclose "The Hall", would you consider using the recently received grille of which the photograph is enclosed, enlarged as sketched?  It has the advantage of not cutting off a great deal of light, yet being interesting in itself.  I was surprised to find it so much more os than the photograph suggests, or-

II. Would you use the one originally intended for the entrance on the plaza, -- enlarged as indicated on enclosed sketch M-167.

III.  The very large circular headed grille I take to be meant for the main doorway and unless you say to the contrary will have it mounted into a frame.

IV.  On the trip last week to the Hill I was delighted with the Royal Suite loggia.  It would make with the sitting room a beautiful summer dining room.

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan
