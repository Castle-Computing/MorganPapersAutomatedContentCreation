John D Costello
Attorney at Law
Crocker First National Bank Building
San Francisco

September 1, 1933.
Mr. J. H. LeFeaver,
c/o Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Mr. LeFeaver:

	If you have a copy of the sales tax act
please look at Section 4 on page 6 thereof, which would
seem to make it quite clear that goods contracted for 
prior to August first, but not delivered or pair for and
not for re-sale, are taxable under the California Sales
Tax Act.

	It further provides that the seller may
add to his bill the amount of the tax involved.

	I suggest, however, that you send me, on
plain paper, a complete statement of the facts giving
me the history of the contract and setting forth the 
reasons why the full delivery of the order was not made at
the time of purchase and other facts which you gave me 
yesterday and I will be glad to submit it to the Headquarters
of the Board of Equalization in Sacramento, as well as to
the Attorney General's office for a ruling in the hope
that there might be some condition attaching to the transaction
which might exempt it from the board interpretation
placed upon Section 4, of the Act.
	
	Very truly yours,
	
		John D. Costello
