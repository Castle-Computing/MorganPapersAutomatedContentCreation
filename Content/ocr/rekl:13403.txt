Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
Would you think well of this change in plan for the esplanade where it leaves the main cross axe? The increase in size of the Main Building over what it was when the cross axe was put in makes the white wall seem too close to the towers to provide satisfactory support, to the eye. I have studied it over all winter and think that by swing-ing the pavement out until the esplanade is on axe with the well terraces, an added interest, as well as an ade-quate base could be had. Also, standing on the well terrace or any where on the esplanade in this region, see-ing another "motif" about symetrically placed with regard to the main stairs, would be very decorative. The repeti-tion of these motifs, small in scale, all around the Main Building would be a happy way to tie the small house scale into that of the main building -- which would have at in-tervals its own scale repeated in the approaches, entrances and terrace fountain group.
Your telegram was received regarding pushing work on the esplanade. I had told Mr. Rossi after asking you, to get the horses as soon as really needed -- but the dryness has made plowing, road work, etc. so far behind they have been able to get along up to now.
We will push this work while finishing the towers, as the scaffolding, machinery, etc. cannot be moved prof-itably till these are done, and they go slowly as men cannot work up there in the high winds.
I will send you a number of rough sketch suggestions for the "motifs" and then work up in detail any you think interesting.
Yours very truly,
[Mansuscript]
It adds much interest
The [big?] building is a whole if I had known it would be so big I would have made the [little] building bigger.
I like this idea very much indeed
I am anxious to know whether you can [complete?] [illegible] this the [illegible] and south terraces under the [illegible] shade oaks that I would like to have. Please see sketches.
Thank Heaven it has rained since.
We should have decent weather in April May and June and a lot can be done. I hope we can get the esplanade finished with the [illegible] you suggest and the rear [illegible] and [illegible] and the rear entrance - which is really THE entrance. I know some of the interiors must be unfurnished but if we can get the lower part of the refectory done and the kitchen [rooms?] we will be fixed for [illegible] This is important part of rear entrance [shown?]
