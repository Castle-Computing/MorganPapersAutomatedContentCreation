Dear Mr. Hearst,-

The "benches provided as pedestals for the marbles of C-A Terrace seem so out of 
proportion and modern, would you consider providing bases made here for the little 
terrace, using these benches on one or another of the new terraces developed Sunday?

I spoke quickly, Sunday, as regards the fish dams, which you may wish to handle in some
 other way than suggested.  If an engineer could go up the creek and locate the best 
 conditions for these dams, could not a crew of Italians, used to rock work build these, 
 under some one's eye occasionally, in a manner that would seem perfectly natural?  If 
 of from six to ten feet deep, counting from the natural pool bottom, walls of rock type
  could be made sufficiently strong.

Yours very truly,
