September 4, 1923.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

You asked me to get you the cost locally of making the marble candelabra after the designs chosen from the drawings at San Simeon.  Mr. Miletin will make the marble shafts for $1200 and $1500 each.  This would still leave the bronze mountings to provide, say at $150 and $450 each -- making the cost actually $1350 for the plainer design and $1950 for the more elaborate one.

The benches for the semicircles of the two well head terraces are ready to ship down.  I think you will approve of them.  The ornament recalls that of the well in each case, and are done with quite a bit of spirit.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
