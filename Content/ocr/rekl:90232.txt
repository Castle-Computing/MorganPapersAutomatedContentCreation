Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Just by way of a memorandum, there was the question of using World's Fair decorations 
and fountains for the corners between walls and between pergolas.

If we cannot get these, we could devise some simple architectural features of seats 
and statuary.

Then there was the question of pavilions or columns at the pool.

Either would be good.

The pavilions might be a more satisfying terminal.

Then there was the question of finishing up the West terrace as the next thing on the 
program.

We need statuary and water there and I think a certain reconstruction of House C.

Then I would like to put old ceilings in the central living rooms of the three small 
houses.

If we do this the ceilings should be raised two or three feet.  Can we do that?  I 
hope so.  It would greatly increase the effectiveness of these rooms.

I think your changes in the new rooms of the theatre wing, making them large and 
luxurious, are splendid.It is so wise to do those things before building instead of after, -- and it is 
cheaper, which is a consideration now-a-days.

Sincerely yours,
s/W R Hearst
