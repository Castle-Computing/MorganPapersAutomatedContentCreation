July 10, 1929.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

On the Hill Sunday, decided to leave the red damask all around the room in place for 
your final inspection as we had to shift positions of tapestries, etc. in order to 
make the damask work out to advantage considering all the various spaces.  Randolph 
calls it the "Red Room", which immediately seems natural.

Different gangs as agreed upon are working in the pool, excavating for the new wing, 
moving the deodors, cypress, etc. for the north terrace, and one on the smaller items
 such as the new tennis court terrace layout, steps to the Neptune Terrace from the 
 path, etc.  The place looks rather torn up.

While Mr. Kreiss was on the Hill I had him send for two needle women to repair the 
hangings of the Doges Suite and the vestibule.  You authorized a needlewoman last 
summer, but I could not get the right one.  These have done the work well.

As to Wyntoon, the tile work on the plunge is progressing well, also the wire enclosure
 of the courts.

As always

Yours very truly,
