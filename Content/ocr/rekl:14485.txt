Dear Mr. Hearst:

I sent Mr. Byne a check for $2500.00 on account, $2000.00 for the six columns, - $200.00 his commission and the rest to credit and cover packing charges.

I also spend unexpectedly $1722.25 on taking up a  draft, custom charges, etc. on the first Byne shipment, which for some reason was not taken care of in New York although Mr. Byne and Mr. McGregor were notified as you directed.

The money to pay the above was taken from the $15,000.00 "especial labor" fund you gave me early in January. So that fund now stands -

	Extra January		$ 5,000.00) Spent on the hill,
	          February		$ 5,000.00) Trinkkeller & Suppo
	Advance to Mr. Byne	$ 2,500.00
	Advance to shipping	$ 1,722.25
					$14,222.25

	Balance to apply on
		March labor		$    777.75	

The San Simeon account since December first stands as follows:

Received December from the San Francisco Examiner	$15,000
"	      January	"	"	"	"	"		$15,000
"	      February	"	"	"	"	"		    5,000
Total -------------------------------------------------------------------	$35,000 

Received from you personally
		February (from Mexico)				$15,000
Total -------------------------------------------------------------------	$50,000 

This leaves us stranded on our budget payment on back bills, as well as current ones and neither Mr. Callahan nor Mr. Heylan seem to have any "allowance" provision for us.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst,

As stated before we can keep within the budget and get the back bills paid up before summer if the money comes regularly -- but having agreed to pay up our bills by definite installments each month, it is jeopardising our whole magnificent financial structure when we slip up a month.

I am sorry to bother you with this again.

Your very truly,

JM-deM
