BYNE CEILING BEAMS WOULD ALL HAVE TO GO BELOW PRESENT CONCRETE BEAMS WHICH MEANS ELIMINATION OF PRESENT CLOISTER TREATMENT OF UPPER WALLS AT BOTH ENDS AND SIDES OF ROOM. IT CAN BE ADJUSTED EASILY TO FIT ROOM & CERTAINLY IS HANDSOME. THE RUIZ CEILING WOULD HAVE THE ADVANTAGE OF NOT DISTURBING PRESENT WALL TREATMENT, IT WOULD TAKE TIME TO PUT UP BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF PARTS ARE LOOSE IN BOXES WITH NO IDENTIFICATION MARKS.
