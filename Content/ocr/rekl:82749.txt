Dear Miss Morgan:

This is our new magazine--THE AMERICAN ARCHITECT.  How do you like it?  I think it is 
improved and will improve further.  This is only our first edition.


There is one article you might be interested in-- namely, the under-lighting of 
swimming pools.

I do not think I like the under-lighting very much.

It is probably interesting in the way of illuminating the swimmers, but I do not think 
it lights the interior of the room to advantage.

However, I think it might be a good system to put in our in-door pool at the ranch and 
have a switch so it could be used or not as wanted.

Let us say, if for any reason we want to shut off the other lights and turn on the pool 
lighting, it would be an interesting novelty; just as it is sometimes pleasant at a 
party to turn vari-colored lights on the dancers for awhile.

But to depend only on that kind of lighting would not be satisfactory.  Therefore, I 
would want both kinds.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
