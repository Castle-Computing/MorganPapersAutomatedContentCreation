Dear Mr. Hearst:

In outlining, in sketch form, a building for Miss Davies, I have tried to make the 
house and garden conform in some of their features to the larger plan we had before, 
while preserving as much of the existing house as possible.

The axis of the house does not lie perpendicular to the rear lot line and parallel to 
the tennis court and it seemed desirable to have the west wall of the garden parallel 
to the courts.  The axis of the house could not be changed and so with these two 
elements established our garden plot developed into the form shown, a form which is 
not unpleasant and which gives, perhaps, more freedom of expression than we had before.

In place of the wings of the larger plan, we would have enclosing walls which, with 
their little towers or turrets, would be picturesque and attractive.

At the end of the garden overlooking the pool, is a loggia, where we had a projection 
room before, and behind the cloisters at either side are dressing rooms and showers, 
six in all, all that Miss Davies thought were desirable.

The pool, 30' x 30', could be finished lke the pool at Wyntoon.  The filter plant 
could be located under the garden and the pool heater could be put in the basement of 
the house with the rest of the heating, i.e., if we want to heat the pool.

The garage for six cars is where we located it before.  There is a shop at one end, 
above which would be the chauffeurs' quarters.

In order to extend the axis of the house along the top of the hill, where we had it 
before, it was necessary to extend the house to the east rather than to me west, and 
the breakfast room bay window was fixed upon as the central feature of the garden facade.
  Then by turning the library and kitchen as flanking wings, we get a symetrical 
  composition on our garden face.

The long dining room facing the garden with wide groups of casements would be a much 
lighter and more cheerful room than that we have at present.

The living room is not increased in size but would be extended if desirable. The 
16' x 16' music room could be made a part of the library and a music room could be 
placed beyond the library adjoining the living room extension.  Miss Davies thought 
the living room was large enough.

There is a corridor or "long gallery" from the post cochere to the entrance hall.  
I have changed the stairs to make them more commodious.

Just how much repair work will be required can not be told until we break through.  
There may not be a great saving in altering over, demolishing and starting new, but 
if we can preserve as much as I have preserved in these plans, I think there would be 
some saving on what entirely new construction would cost.  It is a gamble and I am sure 
that if we depart from the existing lines any farther than I have done, the building 
will cost as much as an entirely new structure, including the wrecking of the old house.

I suppose you would like to have the house heated by steam.  The present heating plant 
is a hot air furnace.

It is difficult to estimate the cost of such a place in the present state of the plans. 
 The house should be figured as an entirely new construction.  You say it should be 
 luxurious and luxury is expensive.

The house as planned herewith could be build for $60,000.00 done in a manner that would 
be considered luxurious to the average client.

The pool and its equipment would cost, I think, about $12,000.00.

The garage, shop and chauffeurs' quarters would cost about $8,000.00.

The loggia and dressing rooms might cost about $8,000.00.

The garden walls, gates, turrets and terrace should not cost over $6,000.00 to 
$10,000.00.

There is a rough estimate - very rough - and totals to about $100,000.00

Yours truly,
