Dear Mr. Hearst:

The crystal cabinet sent by express arrived and is placed in the Social Room as directed.  But, it was put into its case without wedging or other protection and a number of colonnettes were shaken out.  They can be repaired as nothing is actually broken, but it shows again the need of judgment in packing such objects. It is not enough to put a case or shrine within a case.  The objects in case, shrines, etc. should be securely anchored and protected.

Yours very truly,
