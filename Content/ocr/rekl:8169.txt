Please do not let the repairers stain the stalls any different color than they are the reason is I have found other stalls of this same set and they have the same light brown coloring this may be due largely to dirt as the repairers says but it is very agreeable color soft and attractive and giving the appearance of age that is so essential I want to keep this color both because I like it and because it matches these other stalls
