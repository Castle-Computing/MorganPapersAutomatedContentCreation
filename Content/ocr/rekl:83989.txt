June 30th, 1930

Dear Mr. Hearst,-

Am enclosing a recent "daily report"- as to that gate and watchman situation, 
have told them that the next time they are absent without leave they will be suspended 
until your return - and will supply someone to fill in for that period.

In general, work is going along just as programmed, trees are being cared for, 
and relationship reasonably happy.

Yours very truly,
JM-M
