Dear Mr. Hearst:

The owners of the Berkeley palms succumbed to our "$5-apiece" offer as the first palms were being engulfed by the earth from their excavations.

I counted twenty-two last night in the dark -- three or four smaller, but most of them the height of those you have on the Hill, -- and apparently are in good shape.  Do you wish me to send them all up?  The boxing and many handlings make the original cost a drop in the bucket.  On the other hand, they could never be obtained under better conditions or more ready by neglect, poor soil condition, etc.  for further hardship.  Probably not more than three or four could be handled in one boat shipment.

Yours very truly,
