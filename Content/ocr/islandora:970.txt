I have suggested on the drawings that the cross vista from [**] recess to the other in my house would be improved of we had bookcases where the east and west windows are with windows on each side of the bookcases.

I am enclosing an ad of Hampton shops which gives a kind of an idea 
of what I mean.

We thought that steps might go down from the sides of the front terraces in our house to the store room below.

These steps would relieve the side bare spaces and would have some practical value of course.

I have bought some stuff at sales - columns wrought iron gilt and polychrome figures &c which I think you can use.

Am waiting for the final word on the location of the houses.  I think they will be about right as I marked them.
