August 17, 1923.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The owners of the Berkeley property, (The Pacific School of Religion), have decided to keep the palms for their own landscaping.

I will keep an eye out for similar palms -- a number of old places are being broken up and it is quite possible they will be obtainable.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
