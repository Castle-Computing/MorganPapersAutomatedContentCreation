June 3, 1935.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your ideas for the orange boxes seem good. They could be of the white cement.  The 
model would have to be made here as we have no modeler just now at San Simeon.

There are studies of the West terrace for you which I will bring down with a tentative 
study for the orange boxes, also the available information on underwater lighting and 
some suggestions from good sources on some auxiliary direct ray lighting, for which 
one of the companies is sending down some equipment to try out - a loan only.

I will spend Tuesday and Wednesday at Wyntoon as the car arrived at McCloud today and 
be at the Ranch Friday with the measurements of rugs now at Wyntoon, curtain samples,
 etc.  I expected rugs on the car form New York but find they were not included.

As always,

Yours truly,

Julia Morgan
