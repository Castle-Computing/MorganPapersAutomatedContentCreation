Dear Miss Morgan:

I think it best not to attempt to use the plunges in the gymnasium this winter, and I see no reason why we cannot begin the so-called office building as soon as the rainy season is over, or sufficiently over to permit us to work economically.

I do not think we should waste the money on temporary heating plant.

2.  I agree with you entirely that we should do very little work during January February and March.  Let us run as economically as we can during this period, merely finishing up work that is already on the way.

We can begin a vigorous schedule in April, including both the office building and the recreation wing.

I imagine we can also do something in the grounds, completing the walls, terraces, esplanades, etcetera to permit planting as early as possible, - all this to b done from April first on.

I should think that during January February and March a large part of the work would be finishing interiors, the wing for the help, the Gothic suites, etcetera.

I bought a number of nice pictures, some of which will solve problems for us in the big assembly room.

Not only should we be economical in building in the first three months but I think some economies can be made in the running of the ranch.

Perhaps Mr. Slattery will have some ideas on this subject. There is plenty of opportunity for economy there.

Very truly yours,

s/ WR Hearst
