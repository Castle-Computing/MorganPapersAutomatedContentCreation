	Designing the connecting link
between your house and garden

Terraces

Architecturally, the terrace is the connecting link
between the house and its environment. It may be
thought of as belonging equally to the house and to the
garden. And in planning the terrace, both of these factors
must be taken equally into account. 

	Consider first the site of the terrace in relation to 
the landscape. Is the ground in front of it approximately
level; does it slope downward; or does it rise more or
less steeply from the house site? If it is level, as shown
in Fig. 1, no problem exists, except as we may
choose to relieve the monotony of absolute 
flatness, lowering, by two or three feet, the level of the 
lawn or garden immediately in front of the terrace.

	If the ground slopes downward, as in Fig. 2, the 
terrace will be supported on an earth fill kept in place
by a retaining wall. If the nature of the slope permits, a
little grading may create a desirable level area below and 
in front of the terrace.

	When orientation, or other considerations, dictate
that the terrace be placed facing the rising slope of a
hill, as in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4, a number of interesting 
solutions may be worked out. If the slope is not very steep,
it may be feasible to grade upwards in a series of two
or three terraced lawns or gardens; or it may be better to
attempt only a single level area beyond the terrace, with
a retaining wall against the cut in the hill. If the hill is
too steep, this retaining wall may be brought to the very
edge of the terrace, as in Fig. 4, with interesting
opportunities for planting on the slope of the hill.

	In every case, remember that the terrace may be a 
valuable adjunct to the dignity and appearance of the
house; and also that the aspect, looking outward from
the terrace, should be given some focal point (or points)
of interest - especially if a spectacular view is lacking.
This focal point need be nothing more than a bench,
trellis or other garden ornament.

	The materials of which the terrace may be built are
several, as also are the ways in which they may be applied.
There is no basic difference between a terrace
built simultaneously with the house and a terrace added
to an existing house. As shown in Fig. 5, the terrace is
not connected rigidly to the house but is rather a separate
unit, the joint between the two being usually filled
with a water proof mastic. This (Continued on page 72)

Brick and flagging comprise this terrace, the flagging
	playing a comparatively minor role as a top for the
	interesting type of pierced brick wall. The steps are
	placed at the corner in the design shown here
	
Flagstone and hedge. Rectangular stones in random
	patter pave this terrace, the edge of which is marked 
	with a new low hedge. Designs on this page are
	for comparatively level sites with shallow steps
	
Grass joints in stone require no upkeep and make a 
	terrace paving in perfect harmony with a Pennsylvania
	type stone house. The interesting central step is
	composed of a grindstone rescued from an old millJune 1933

DONE IN STONE. For a niche among rocks or
ledges the design above has a particular fitness.
Natural stones and a few slabs serve 
for materials and are adaptable to an infinite
number of variations. Here the flue
must be more than twice as large as normal
to compensate for a very short chimney

SITE FOR A PICNIC. One of the major 
disfigurements of the best of picnic grounds
is the usual messy fireplace arrangement.
At the left is suggested a permanent design
for a hearth, with a low chimney, a 
raised fore ledge for convenience, and a
flue three times normal size. This should
be placed to face into prevailing winds.

BACK YARD BARBECUES. Of brick and cement,
with hood and chimney of painted sheet metal, 
the corner fireplace at the right, with 
its revolving spit, tells its own story. As 
in all the other suggestions, great variety
of pattern and placing is possible. And in
addition a purely decorative end is added
to the more obvious practical one achieved
