Dear Mr. Hearst:

The alternate ceiling sketches for "C" mailed today are still inspired by the idea that "C" on account of the Loggia treatment is a bit earlier than "B", and the ceilings therefore, would have a trace of Moorish or earlier beamed motifs.  "B" has become so rich in quality by the "Golden Stair: addition, that the sitting room ceiling could be later and more "modeled".

I can get a good imitation plaster Caen Stone and Traventine finish for the hall walls of "A" and "B", but the Caen Stone could be done by the regular plastersers, and the Traventine would require sending up another crew; would you under the circumstances , take the Caen Stone?

The floor tile are just out of the kiln and as soon as cooled will mail you some.  The oblong ones are the same size and color as in the cut you sent, and by waxing in a short time will come to the same smooth texture.

If you would prefer a Traventine floor, I have located some in a local marble yard where it has lain many years.

Enclosed is a portion of the last report on your work, which explains itself.  It would be a good plan to buy the small mixer as it can be shifted around to sites that the large one could not be moved to, and the value is always in it for re-sale.

Bad weather outside has put the shipping schedules out again. The "Nicholson" could not even put in at Monterey Bay this trip and had to bring her cargo back.  The needed cement and lumber will go down this trip, but the mill strike prevented the frames etc. being touched.

Yours very truly,
