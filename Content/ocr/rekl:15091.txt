January 18, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In writing the specifications for the chicken house I have said that the site would be delivered graded and that the sand, cement and gravel would be provided at the site  by you, also the roofing tile.  As we need the form lumber, I have not allowed its use.

The specifications do not include linoleum for kitchens and baths, the iron work on exterior, or the fenced and walled enclosures for the chicken runs.

Yours very truly,



[Handwritten note on above Letter]

Explained to Mr H but better not sent
