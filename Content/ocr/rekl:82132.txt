Los Angeles Examiner, Office of the Publisher, Broadway at Eleventh St., Los Angeles

August 29, 1929.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I think Mr. Joy is rather seriously ill and I would like to have Dr. Moffat or some 
other competent physician see him and diagnose his case. 

Will you try to arrange this? I will be responsible for the charges.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
