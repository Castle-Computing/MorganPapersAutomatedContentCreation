Dear Miss Morgan :

Of the various designs for the English house, I
like best No. 3, because it takes most account of the view..
To my mind, the view is the important thing on the hill-- that is
the reason we come to the hill-- and all our houses should be aimed
at the view; that is, constructed so as to get the best view
from the windows.

I would modify 3 very materially, however, putting a
dining room where you now have the buttery and kitchen, and perhaps
a billiard room where you now have the billiard room in 4.

Then the buttery and kitchen could be an extension beyond
the diningroom and below, or rather beyond, the tree marked 2.
There would be room there for various outâ€”buildings, including kitchen
servants diningroom, and servants' rooms if you wish.

I have sketched on the big plan an idea for a house which is
more set and severe, and a little more like the manner of house we
have built in other places. I do not know that the scale is just
right,-- I am afraid it is a little large,- but the idea is there.

I would have an entrance hall as marked, with a fireplace.
in the back and a stair treatment somewhat like the Hacienda, with
the stairs going up behind the fireplace to the hall above; on each
side of the entrance hall, parlors or bedrooms.

In the rear would be the dining room, which is the great
hall-- eighteen or twenty feet high. There would be big windows
at each end or fireplaces at each end-- just as you thought best--
in which case the windows would be at each side of the fireplaces
and there would also be windows in the rear.

The pantry, kitchen and other servants' rooms are
marked.

That is all there is to that suggestion, except that
the staircase would go up from the second floor hall another half-
length to get to the rooms over the banqueting hall, which would
be of course six or eight feet higher than the rooms over the entrance
hall, I think it would work out practically.

Mrs. Hearst suggests a billiard room and if we put in a
billiard room it should go where I now have servants' rooms marked.
The servants' rooms and cut-houses could then go adjoining the
kitchen to the east. They would be well out of the way.

Mrs. Hearst, being a good wife, likes my plan better, So
perhaps you would better see what you can do in the way of develop-
ing my plan.Miss Julia Morgan--2 3-15-22
Mrs. Hearst thinks that this would make a great house for the boys when we are all at the hill this summer, and of course it would make a fine house for the whole family any time that we do not want to open up all the other houses.
I think the gables would work out well front and back, putting them over the bedrooms. The part of the house over the great hall being higher than that over the front section might make an interesting architectural effect. You will know best about that.
Sincerely yours,

We could also use some decorative hand plaster on the faces if you like it is very quaint.
