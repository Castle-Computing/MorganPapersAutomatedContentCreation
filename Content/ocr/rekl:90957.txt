W.R.H. #2

There is no plate glass to be brought in California at present,
and not firms will take order with any promises attached
as to delivery. I had to take one of the modelers up to 
San Simeon this week and convince him that it was a "lovely
place" and then have him telephone from there back to the 
shop that I was voracious, before the cast-cement crew would
agree to go up. These are examples. 

	Your were evidently right about getting a country
trained builder, for I do not believe we could have held a 
city man. The San Francisco men sent down on the "bonus"
plan have nearly all come back, one turned back at San Simeon
some get to the top of the hill and did not unpack, and some
stayed a week or more. They all agreed that the living conditions, 
money and food were all right, but thy "didn't 
like feeling so far away from things". Mr. Washburn is 
picking up "country" men as fast as he can, as he says the 
discontent of all hands caused by the last experiment put
him back instead of forward.

	The better road conditions have made it possible
to take up a rented concrete mixer of suitable size, which
was not possible before. It was almost in place yesterday.

	The trucks you ordered for us arrived last
Friday, and will help a lot as one of the old ones is 
entirely out of commission. I told Mr. Washburn to hire a
man who owns his own truck to bring it and make up for this
loss.

	The Steamer did not discharge until the 31st of
March. They began settling at the wharf in San Francisco
while loading and 80 tons had to be taken off before she
started. The she sprung a leak trying to head in to San 
Simeon on the way down and wet our plaster and cement stored
below decks to be kept dry; and then lost two days making
a landing and unloading on the way up. The Steamship
Company does not love us. 

	The floor of House "B" is poured and the framing
for the walls will be started this week. The reinforcement 
is three-quarters placed in the floor for "C", and concrete
work will go in next week. The walls and floors of the 
lower story of "A" are ready for pour; this is going to take
some time as they go way down the hillside. The plumbing
piping is well along.W.R.H #3 

	I am sending you as a record the concrete
drawings for all three houses as last revised. They
do not show finish. 

	With the present fleet of trucks twenty-five
toms a day can be hauled if all the trucks work all day on
teaming. There were 600 tons in the last shipment which 
means 25 days teaming, but undoubtedly there will be some
rainy days. The next shipment on the 16th will be 130 tons
etc. This leaves no trucks for hauling rock so that I have
asked Mr. Washburn to get two men who own trucks on from 
Monterey and one form San Luis Obispo, at so much per day
for truck and driver. He is looking out for another in 
addition. 

	The tile for the roof and the men to put it on 
are arranged for also everything in connection with 
plumbing and for tiling of bath rooms. In fact, both plumbing
fixtures and tile are down there. 

	As regards gloor tile we can get an effect very
much like in the photograph of the room in the Villa
Palmerie which you sent, with the 6 X 12 dark redish tiles
I wrote you of. I thought by using these in the large rooms
and the pattern tiles and smaller square tile in some bed 
rooms we could get a rich and satisfactory floor. 

	It is the only chance we have as not other tile
in colors can be had here this summer, and no order given
to an eastern firm could be filled in time to meet the 
various shipping conditions even were it for fall instead of summer. 

Yours very truly,
