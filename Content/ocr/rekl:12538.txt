Dear Miss Morgan:

There are so many deer on the ranch that we are going to have a great deal of trouble with the planting and the only way to prevent it is to fence in the new planting exactly as we had to do with the orchards with high fences.

The fencing I planned would have surrounded the orchard independently and then run down the hill from the westernmost point of the orchard, including the plots where the sequoias are planted and back along the western bank of the Canyon and up north of the garage and north of Chinese Hill to the eastern end of the orchard.

This would have included all the planting district except the conifer planting on Reservoir Hill.  If the fence had been built this way and built right it should and will keep the deer up, but I am afraid Mr. Gillespie has had some over-ambitious scheme of fencing which encounters unnecessary difficulties and makes it difficult, if not impossible, to have the fence deer-proof.

This elaborate plan of fencing also probably accounts for the delay in finishing the fencing because, if my simple plan had been followed, there is no reason why the fencing should not have been completed in one-half of this time.

If my plan has not been followed I suggest that you do it now.  First, because it is not too big to make perfect.  Second, because it goes over reasonably easy ground.  Third, because it is necessary t protect all the planting in the neighborhood of the houses.

In addition to this outer fence of mine there was an inner fence to start from the same gate at the western point of the orchard and run almost east well below the road to include and protect the orchard planting outside the original orchard enclosure. That is to say, the oranges, figs, etc., and also some cherries and ordinary orchard fruits that had been planted south of the road.  This fence ran around the houses and joined the other east of the garage where there was to be an east gate.

I am enclosing a very rough diagram which may give you an idea of what I mean.  The round ring are the houses on the hill; the double lines are the road; the oblong ring is the orchard, and the points of the compass are give -- north, south, east and west.
The fences are the dark single lines.  None of them cross the Canyon which is indicated at the extreme edge of the paper by loopy lines t represent trees and labelled Canyon.

The advantage of this plan is that it does protect what you need protected and it gives double protection to what you want protected most and finally if it becomes desirable to take in anymore extended area that can be done later by whatever fencing is necessary.

The conifer planting on Reservoir Hill will have to be protected by its own lines of fencing.

In addition to fencing it is sometimes necessary t protect newly planted trees by putting arsenic on their leaves.  This kills the small things like rabbits that eat the plants.

Will you please write me about the fencing.  I am in the dark about it and have only seen occasional indications of it in letters or drawings which would seem to show gallivanting away over towards Reservoir Hill in the most impractical manner.  First, as I said, because of the expense of including so large an area and second, because of the impossibility of making such a fence deer-proof when it has to cross creek bottoms and go over all kinds of difficult country.

I expressly told Mr. Gillespie I did not want that kind of a fence although he had it in mind when I talked to him.  I outlined what I did not want unfortunately only in words which can easily be forgotten or disregarded.  Here I have tried to do it in a diagram.

Sincerely,
