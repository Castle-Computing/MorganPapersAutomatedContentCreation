[Letter]

(Letterhead: Los Angeles Examiner, Office of the Publisher, Broadway at Eleventh St., Los Angeles)

June 7, 1926.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst left me this memo --

"I would like a sprinkler system installed at the ranch-- the kind where pipes are laid underground, and all that is necessary is to turn on a faucet, and the thing squirts."

I assume that he would want this supervised by you; so will you be good enough to look into it and have it installed.  The memorandum was written on the advertisement in COUNTRY LIFE for May of THE SKINNER IRRIGATION CO., 218 Water St., Troy, Ohio which I enclose.

2.  Please note Mr. Hearst's memo for you at bottom of clipping B, about fenders.

3.  Also Mr. Hearst instructed me to ask you kindly to order carnations and hollyhocks plentifully for the ranch.  "I know they are troublesome," he said, "but I like them extremely."

Sincerely,

s/ J Willicombe
