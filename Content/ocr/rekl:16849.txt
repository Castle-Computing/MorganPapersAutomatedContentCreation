DISCOURAGED TRYING TO LIVE IN HOUSES THAT ARE APPARENTLY NOT TO BE LIVED IN THE FACT THAT HEATING IS NO BETTER THAN IT WAS AND THAT WINDOWS ARE NOT WEATHERSTRIPPED AND PROPERLY PROTECTED MAKE HOUSES NO BETTER THAN MOVING PICTURE ET I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE STEPS TO MAKE THEM LIVABLE BEFORE UNDERTAKING OTHER THINFS
