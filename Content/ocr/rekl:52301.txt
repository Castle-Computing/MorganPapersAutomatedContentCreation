San Francisco Examiner,
October 24th, 1927.

Dear Mr. Rossi:-

The enclosed copy of letter from Mrs. W.R. Hearst is self-explanatory.

I have been in touch with these people and they will arrive in San Luis Obispo by motor Thursday night and drive out to the ranch Friday morning.  Will you please have someone meet them at the Anderson Hotel Friday morning and direct them to the ranch.  They will just be there for the day and you will, of course, have a lunch prepared for them.  Will you also take them in hand when they arrive on the hill and show them about the place.

Thanking you for any attention you may give these people, I remain,

Sincerely yours,

George Hearst.
