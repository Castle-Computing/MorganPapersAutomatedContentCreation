March 20, 1927.
Dear Miss Morgan:

I rather imagined Mr. Guthers would be unreasonable,
and of course a man with those kind of ideas I think would be wholly
impractical in other ways.

Mr. Williams seems to be a much better type of man and the I
salary is not excessive.

Let us get him on the job as soon as possible. I am
shipping a good deal of stuff up from Los Angeles and other materials
are coming from the East.

2. I have your letter about the distribution of the
various things from the Hacienda. I am glad these various things
found some useful application.

I had a nice letter from Mrs. Leonard about the things
sent her. There may be a number of nicer things that you are
keeping with the idea that they might be used some time but probably
will not be.

Perhaps Mrs. Leonard could select some of these things
that she would find useful.

If there are any of these things of rather doubtful use
to us and certain use to her, please let her have them.

Sincerely,

[handwritten]
