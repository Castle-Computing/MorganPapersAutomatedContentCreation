Regret dont like glass or stone frames in small upper windows of study.  Think we 
will have entirely to redo this.  Suggest single narrower pointed Gothic windows 
with or with (?).  I think it will go better with the glass and with the room 

WRHPerhaps we can get a number of these windows in old material 

I have something in mind
