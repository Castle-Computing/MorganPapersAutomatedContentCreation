Mr. Randolph Apperson, 
San Simeon, Calif. 

Dear Randolph:

	Confirming my telegram from here today, following 
are further instructions from Chief in connection with the closing 
of the Hilltop which he has just told me to send you. 

	The original plan to close the place, as previously outlined, 
are unchanged in general. This letter will convey to you, 
however, some detail of what Chief desires. 

	First, close the Hacienda or Hilltop up tight.
	
	Keep Lys and Pio and Hedwig and Charlie Harris and Dally, 
the help's cook, and one kitchen boy, whichever one Dally prefers.

	For watchmen -- use Mr. Baldwin in the daytime, and two men 
only at night. You will have to let one of the watchmen go, and 
as Mooney and Welbanks are the oldest in time of service, Chief 
instructs to keep. 

	Also he instructs to keep Ray Swartley, who can act as relief
for the watchmen on their days off, and the other three days can 
be useful in other ways-- in or out of the houses or castle-- as you 
direct. 

	Chief wishes Marks Eubanks and George Brunner kept on and as
the place will not be in use and no water in the pools Brunner's work
will be greatly lessened-- so that Chief wishes him to assist Eubanks
also in keeping things from deteriorating. 

	Reduce the number of gardeners by half, Chief says, and give 
Mr. March $25 a month more salary.

	Chief further states that the orchard force under Mr. Keep 
cannot be reduced immediately, as he has a lot of trees to plant
which would spoil if not planted. 

	"Mr. Williams should sleep in the Hacienda and keep careful 
supervision," Chief instructs. "Mr. and Mrs. Redelsperger can go
to Wyntoohnin a couple of weeks and get things ready there with 
an extremely small force."

	Chief has in mind to keep Wyntoon open during the summer, 
live at Santa Monica in winter, and not open the Hacienda until Spring. Los Angeles Examiner

	Incidentally, Chief says that George Lootz can use his
best men on the bunk house at San Simeon for next three months
and then we will resume work on the Hacienda. 

	WILL YOU KINDLY GET THIS SUGGESTION TO GEORGE, 
	
	And also tell him Chief says that "if things are not 
sufficiently finished at Wyntoon by the end of June, we may run 
another month or so moderately."

	Finally, Chief wishes you to have a powerful siren installed
on the Hilltop-- in one or both of the towers, to be used 
as a means of protection against intruders, or rather to sound
warning in case of serious intrusion. 

	And in this connection, kindly see that there is no other 
siren used on the Hilltop. 

	I AM SENDING COPY OF THIS LETTER TO MISS MORGAN SO THAT 
SHE WILL BE INFORMED FULLY. 

	Best wishes, 
	
	Sincerely yours,
