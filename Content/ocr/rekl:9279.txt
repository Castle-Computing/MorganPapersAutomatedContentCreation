Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In regard to the tapestries at the Ranch House.  The cedar box is locked so the tapestries could not be counted, but I had the whole chest boxed and sent Wells Fargo, insured through Mr. Lee to Mr. Kinkaid directly at the Hacienda.

Hoping this is satisfactory,

Yours very truly,
