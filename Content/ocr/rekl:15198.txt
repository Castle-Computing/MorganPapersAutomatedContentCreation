Dear Mr. Hearst:

On the Hill yesterday little damage was done to the plants, orchard or houses.  The road suffered, and the orchard had heavy lines of wash.  Mr. Keep says they are well offset by their advantages.

The buildings did not suffer beyond a couple of small stains under the usual two windows.

The chimney and window men were not a success I am truly sorry to say.  John called me in to see the big plate window in your sitting room which was left so it could not be shut or fastened.  I told Mr. Rossi to fix this as a storm was evidently coming, but to leave the fireplace until you gave instructions.  The chimney man evidently went away discouraged, the fireplace and flues both being left in bad shape.

The new fireplace is up in the Hall and looks its price -- could not have fitted better or been in better scale, color, etc.  Would you like a raised hearth for this?  of its own stone.

If they vestibule does not make Mrs. Hearst weep I will be disappointed -- it promises well.

Yours very truly,
