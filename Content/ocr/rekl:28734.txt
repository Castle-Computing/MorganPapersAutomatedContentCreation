YOU MAY DO AS YOU SUGGEST ABOUT ORCHIRD GARDEN AND ANIMAL EXPENSES OR IF YOU NEED THE ALLOWANCE YOU CAN MAKE THIS SEPARATE AND ADDITIONAL PARAGRAPH 2 HOW MUCH OF THIS IS ANIMAL EXPENSE I AM AFRAID IT IS RUNNING HIGH AND DISPOSED TO GET RID OF CARNIVEROUS ANIMALS IF THAT WOULD REDUCE EXPENSE.

W R HEARST
1926 Total per month for all animal provisions etc - including work horses = $608.50 (This includes food for work horses but not care of stable, as teamsters handle that)
