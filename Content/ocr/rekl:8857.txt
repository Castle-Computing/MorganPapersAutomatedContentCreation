(Letterhead: San Francisco Examiner)

San Simeon, California.
September 9th, 1921.

Dear Miss Morgan:-

Mr. Hearst issued enclosed instructions today, which are self-explanatory.

Heretofore I have been checking everything that came up the hill, material, antiques, furnishings, etc., but from the instructions you will not that I am to have nothing to do with the construction end of it all, that coming under Mr. Washburn's department.

He wants all bills for articles other than construction sent here for O.K. before payment, but I imagine they will all come through the Examiner.

Very truly yours,
L. F. Bentchien
Sept. 9-21

Make an itemized list of what  comes in whether it is boxed or not.  Get a detailed invoice or complete list from The Examiner and if you cannot get that, open the boxes and check out the individual things.  

Have everything delivered at once place and to on responsible individual or his alternate.

This applies to everything except the construction, that is, material that comes under Mr. Washburn's department for which he is responsible.

W. R. HEARST.
