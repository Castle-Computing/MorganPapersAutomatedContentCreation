Miss Flood phoned. Said Mr.
Willicombe thought you might
take up with the Stringer Storage
Co. the matter of of reduction
of their storage bill, as 
musch has moved out of their 
warehouse recently.

I told her you never had made
any arrangements with them regarding
rental -(when she looked
up the older bills she saw
that the bill used to be $750
where it was $145 now, etc.)
She said she would find out
who was taking care of the 
rate, etc.
