MERCHANTS EXCHANGE BLDG SANFRANCISCO CALIF

I HAVE CEILING CONTAINING FIFTEEN LARGE FULL LENGTH FIGURES OF SAINTS IN RECTANGLES SIZE OF WHOLE CEILING BEING EIGHTEEN METERS BY NINE METERS THIS MIGHT BE IDEAL CEILING FOR REFECTORY IT IS RENAISSANCE PERIOD BUT NO PARTICULARLY CHARACTERISTIC DECORATION WOULD THIS BE OUT OF CHARACTER WITH THE GOTHIC STALLS AND ARCHES OF COURSE IT IS NOT AS GOOD AS A GOTHIC CEILING BUT IT MIGHT BE BETTER THAN A MOORISH ONE HOW SHALLOW MUST CEILING BE HOW MANY INCHES BETWEEN CONCRETE BEAMS AND TOP OF GOTHIC DECORATION 2 I AM IN FAVOR OR BOTH ROADS THE B
SECTION AND THE CANYON SECTION BUT I THINK THE B SECTION SHOULD BE RESURVEYED TO ELIMINATE FOUR TURNS BETWEEN GOAT ROCK AND STRAWBERRY HILL BY RUNNING A LONG LOOP OVER INTO THE TREES ON THE EAST AS FAR AS POSSIBLE AND MAKING A BIG TURN AND COMING BACK ON THE HILL ABOVE GOAT ROCK TO MAKE ANOTHER WIDE TURN THIS WOULD MAKE ONLY TWO TURNS ALTHOUGH THE GRADE MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY STEEPER I AGREE ABOUT THE CANYON ROAD AND THINK WOODEN BRIDGE ON CONCRETE PIERS ENOUGH FOR PRESENT 3 USE THE MEN TO CONTINUE ROAD AROUND TO CROSS AXE STAIR AND FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSES TO HASTEN COMPLETION
