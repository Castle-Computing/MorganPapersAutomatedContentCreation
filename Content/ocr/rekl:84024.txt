THINK FIRE VERY SERIOUS WOULD RATHER HAVE BUILDING BURN THAN TREES PLEASE ARRANGE 
REPLANT ALL TREES WITH SMALL LIVEOAKS THESE WILL TAKE LONG TIME GROW BUT SOONER 
PLANTED SOONER WILL BE GROWN 2 DO NOT THINK INCINERATOR OR OTHER FIRES SHOULDBE BUILD 
IN DRY SEASON HAVE ELECTRICITY FORHEATING FURTHERMORE PETROLEUM SHOULD BE USED AND IF 
PROPERLY PROTECTED DOESNT MAKE SPARKS 3 FIRST THING AFTER WINGS FINISHED IS TOBUILD 
ABSOLUTELY SAFE MACHINERY AND HEATING CENTER SOUTHEAST CORNER OF HILL WHICH WILL ONLY 
USE PETROLEUM UNDER COMPLETE PROTECTION 4 FURTHER SECURITY WOULD BE PLOUGH UP DRY 
GRASS WITHIN HUNDREDYARDS HILLTOP 5 DONT PUT WEBB BACK TEMPERAMENTAL NUISANCE I THINK 
MUCH BETTER HAVE GOOD ROSEMAN AND OTHER GOOD SPECIALISTS UNDER COMPETENT EXECUTIVE=
