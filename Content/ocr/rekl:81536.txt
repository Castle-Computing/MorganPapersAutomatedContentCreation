Dear Miss Morgan:

I understand the plan to be -

First that we will finish the terraces
which we are actually working on now, - namely
the South terrace, the terrace in front of B,
the terraces on each side of the pool and the
plaza terrace in front of the main house.

Then we will do the interior pool
and baths under the tennis court and the new
roof to the main building.

Incidentally we will install the
elevator and the bells if they arrive.

I imagine these things will carry us
until about Christmas.

(Signed) W. R. H.
