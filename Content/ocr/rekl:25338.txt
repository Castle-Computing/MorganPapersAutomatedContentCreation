April 18, 1927.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This is to acknowledge the receipt from you yesterday, April 17th, of -

1.  A check for $5,000.00 to be sent Marcel Michiels, Belgium, as approximately half payment on the player equipment for the carillon.

2.  And a check for $10,000.00 for the San Simeon Fund.  This check I have deposited in your "special" account although it will have to be used in the emergency for current bills.  (You have two San Simeon accounts in our care - one of which we deposit the money received through Mr. Neylan, and one "Special Fund" account for money you provide for definite purposes.  Both funds are audited by the auditor from Mr. Neylan's office, but no accounting is made to him of the special funds.)

Yours very truly,
