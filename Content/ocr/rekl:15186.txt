Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.  The Beverly House drawings are ready for you any time and place you wish.

2.  The enclosed choir stall photographs came today and are certainly very rich and they are easy to adapt.  I am wondering if the detail is too small.  It is hard to judge.

3.  Your telegram also in here regarding depth of, and heat for, the pool.  Heating will mean a chimney stack somewhere, as it would not be practical to heat by electricity.

4.  I telegraphed Mr. Rossi, I hope in time, to not take down the steel over the mantel of the refectory we decided to take down Monday in order to put up the fireplace.  Do you see the arches back enclosing the organ?  Also, perhaps we will have to go back to the paintings over the doorways in the main room instead of the design of paneling decided on, -- our old scheme being to cut out the concrete wall back of the paintings in order to let the sound come into the big room through the canvas.

Yours very truly,

2.  There are two sets of stalls quite singular but not identical I think both can be used and they would almost complete the wainscoting.  I have a lot of these if you can use them and I think we can.

3.  I feel sure that we can heat water pipes by electricity and the water pipes can heat the pool.  I dont think we can have a stack  Lets try electricity in some form

4.  All right but we could have a grille of wood in the panelling if you greatly prefer panelling.  It√ïs important to get the loudest organ and a fine (?) of (?)

Yes.  (with arrow to "Do you se the arches back enclosing the organ?"
