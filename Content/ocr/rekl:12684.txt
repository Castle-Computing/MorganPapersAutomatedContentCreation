Dear Miss Morgan

Mr. Hearsts house is amazingly rich.  He has four floors of a large apartment house (The topmost floors) I saw but the principal rooms of the 10th and eleventh, the lower two floors.  They are well executed but it seems to me what might have been truly stunning effects of vistas and connections have just been missed.  The furniture is not altogether suitable and is wretchedly arranged (I believe that even I could have done as well )  By comparison, we need not feel ashamed of the San Simeon houses, but he has secured a dignity of proportion here that the San Simeon houses cannot have in the manner.  The ceiling of the central room (Recept.Hall) is an antique and the other two upper ceiling are made to match. 
His colored windows show that we can give the refectory a glory through the medium of glass that nothing else would do.

One upper room is a museum of treasures of archeology - pottery, small bas reliefs, statuettes and jewelry from ancient Greece and Egypt and - South America (!) with a few scattered gothic carvings.  George Thompson calls it the "Greek Room "
Best Wishes from
T.Joy
