Dear Mr. Hearst:

The letter stating your decision to have all personal insurance matters handled 
through Mr. R.A. Clark's office is received.  Certainly we will do as you ask and 
keep Mr. Clark notified as to shipments.  We have never in any way had to do with 
placing of insurance, but have notified in writing originally Mr. Bogart, and then 
Mr. Minott, as to movements of goods, so that coverage could be provided.  In the 
future I will have mailed to you a duplicate of such communications.

Yours very truly,
