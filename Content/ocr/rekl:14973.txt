Mr. William R. Hearst,
Los Angeles, California.

Re. Beam painting for Refectory.  
Main Building, San Simeon, Cal.

Dear Mr. Hearst:-

Experiments have convinced me that the painting can be done on cloth and then applied to the beams with white lead without any texture of cloth nature being apparent.  In other words when the work is complete the effect will be of painted wood beams.

The toning and ageing can be done after the painted strips are applied assuring the proper effect required by the light conditions in the Refectory.

I will have three six foot strips completely painted by the middle of January.  Which will be for a six foot length of the two sides and face of beam.  If you will still be in California at that time I will send them out there for your inspection or if you are in New York at that time will be pleased to show them there

Am at present getting all information and date concerning the Chiramonte ceiling, from the libraries of Columbia University, Met. Museum of Art.  In addition to information Miss Morgan gave me.

In addition to Edw,F,Caldwell Co. have loaned color plates from "Art Italiana".

All of this work for the beams could be done here in New York in my workshop and sent to the job ready to be applied.  would you kindly give this plan your consideration and if you think well of it your approval.

There are several good reasons that I can advance in support of the plan.  The work can be done under proper light and studio conditions, can be started at once and be advanced rapidly while the ceiling is being prepared for the painting, be under my personal supervision at all times at less expense that on the job.

The cost of doing the work will be greatly lessened than if done at San Simeon, where traveling expenses and board and lodging figure and I can engage members of the Art Students League to do preliminary work for less money than regular mechanics would demand on the job, considerably less.

Another point has come up in the last few days that will materially figure.  I have an Artist on the job that is now receiving 63.00 per week and is working on the ceiling of Lobby 
of entrance to Refectory.  He demands an increase to 80.00 per week for the work he is doing.  To grant the increase will establish a precedent and every other man that would have to be engaged on the job to do the Refectory ceiling would ask the same pay.  I am not at liberty to grant this increase without submitting the question to you for your consideration.  I have informed this man that, Mr. Serbaroli that his request will receive due consideration and he would  have to await a decision. He wanted the increase to take effect with his wages due on Dec. 12th.

I am hoping that you will consent to have me do that portion of the work mentioned, here in New York City on account of expediency and lesser cost.  Have advised Miss Morgan of these questions.

Would you kindly let me have your decision as soon as possible.

In addition, Mr. Hearst, my cash on hand has been exhausted for some time, I have been compelled to borrow money on notes and have to keep renewing them, a busy fall and slow payments have drawn my money in all directions.  Would you kindly relieve the tension and send me a check.

With best wishes to you and your family for a Merry Christmas and A Happy, healthy and prosperous New Year.

Respectfully yours,

s/ Frank R. Humrich
