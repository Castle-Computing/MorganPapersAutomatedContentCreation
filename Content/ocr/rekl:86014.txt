Dear Miss Morgan:

I have read over Mr. Bistany's letter and Mrs. Hearst's telegram regarding the 
condition of the animals on the hill and am returning same to you, herewith.

I wish to make the following statements regarding some of the various points and 
individuals mentioned in the correspondence.

1.	First, I believe 95% of the "lack of Care" to be due to a program of economy for 
which Mrs. Parks is responsible only as the agent of those above him.

2.  	I feel that Carey Baldwin did all that could be done with the limited supply 
of food and help provided him for care of the animals.  He was in full knowledge of
 most of the necessities mentioned in Mr. Bistany's letter, many of which it appears 
 that he personally has told Mr. Bistany.

3.	Carey Baldwin's absence during the summer was for the sole purpose of studying 
zoology, which he did conscientiously and well, to better fit himself for his position. 
		I doubt very much whether Mr. Baldwin left without the full permission of 
		the authorities over him.  At the same time he left a very capable, hard 
		working, experienced man in charge.

4.	The man Mr. Hearst refers to as one "who did know how to take care of giraffes" 
is the Mr. Perkins I referred to last night as a highly capable animal caretaker.  
I wish to add in Mr. Baldwin's defence, that tho' Mr. Perkins would be very very hard 
to replace, either in his present position as Janitor or as a Giraffe caretaker, he 
has a personality that conflicts with most of those he works with.  Mr. Perkins is 
one of those very clever, industrious individuals who will take advise from few if any.

5.	Mr. Baldwin has never had fewer than four men besides himself instead of three as 
Mr. Bistany writes.

6.	About June all of the men in the animal crew were arbitrarily cut 20% including 
Mr. Baldwin.  This was a rather discouraging blow to those who should better have 
expected a raise.  In particular, Harry De Hayes, has had charge of the animals in 
the zoo for some five years and has not lost a single animal (excepting new born) in 
that time.  This in spite of the deplorable conditions of which Mr. Bistany speaks is 
a mark of accomplishment.
7.	Mr. Baldwin has repeatedly requested quarters and complained of the limited 
funds available for feeding.  He has done this persistently in written specific 
requests and because he has perhaps been a little too polite to demand action he 
is to be let out.  He was promised improvements which were so consistently postponed 
that his attitude became "Well all I can do is to call things to their attention, 
then if they cannot meet my requests there is nothing else I can do".

8.	I wish to state that, since I've been on the hill, Mr Baldwin has cooperated 
with me in every way.

9.	Finally, It is my opinion that to attain anything like the conditions suggested 
in Mr. Bistany's letter, will cost Mr. Hearst a lot more if Mr. Baldwin is replaced 
by a man who is perhaps more capable of handling animals than men.  The man in charge 
must have full authority to select & pay good willing, preferably experienced men, 
who will enjoy working under conditions prevelant on this Hill.

10.	Refrigeration is necessary for most of the animals in the zoo, for most of them 
are meat eaters and it is the next thing to impossible to keep the needed quantities 
fresh under present conditions.  The elimination of these animals would be the loss 
of some of his finest specimens.

Miss Morgan I have made the above statements to you just as I would make them to 
Mr. Hearst and am willing that you quote me if you wish.

Further, I have absolutely no personal interest in this matter as Mr. Baldwin and 
I have nothing in common since our departments are distinctly separate.  It is only 
for the best interest of the job and Mr. Hearst personally that I submit these 
statements for your consideration.

Very truly yours,

s/ Geo. C. Loorz
