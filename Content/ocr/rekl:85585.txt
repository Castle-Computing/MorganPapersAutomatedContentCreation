Dear Mr. Hearst:

One of the reasons for wanting so much to come to the Hill Tuesday was because of 
realizing that Mr. Solone loses confidence without definite direction.  I am sorry 
for the what happened and have already arranged to bring Mr. Solon down after next 
Tuesday's trip.

I regret much the very short visit.

Your very truly
