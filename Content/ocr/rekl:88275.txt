Trucks and tractors "huff and puff" to clear swampland near Flushing.
Long Island. in preparation for New York's I939 World's Fair. Since no
architectural scheme has deﬁnitely been decided upon. the present
work will consist largely of leveling and preliminary landscaping

bedrooms and bath upstairs, living
room, dining alcove and kitchen on the
ﬁrst ﬂoor, Clayton Grandy of the Brick
Manufacturers Association expects the
building to show the beauty and beneﬁts
of brick construction for the man of
average income. A reinforced brick
beam on top of the footings makes it
possible to move the building after the
Exposition closes, when, probably, it
will become the home of one of the

The “traditional house of wood” (so—
called by the Lumber Institute) is in
the $15,000 class. Replete-with many
of the most advanced developments of
construction and prefabrication, this
house demonstrates, says H. A. Kramer,
Institute secretary, the “economy, de—
sirability, and beauty of wood as com—
pared to other materials.”

The wood structure is 52 by 34 feet
and has twelve rooms. All wall panel—
ing, all stairwork, window frames and
the dining roorm ﬂoor are of prefabric—
ated units. Windows move in and out
for washing purposes, in addition to
the regular up and down movement.

Downstairs, the living room is of old-
fashioned strip ﬂooring. The sidewall,
where the ﬁreplace is located, is of
crotch cypress, prefabricated. A small
“powder room” is entirely of knotty
pine paneling. The dining room is of
prefabricated preﬁnished units, eight
inches square, laid in mastic, making
the ﬂoor moisture proof.

Golden Gal-e

“Golden Gate International Exposi-
tion—A Pageant of the Paciﬁc.” This
musical, alliterative phrase is now the
ofﬁcial name of the 1939 World’s Fair
on San Francisco Bay. Selected from
more than 12,000 titles suggested, this

name now formally replaces the more 7 7

matter ' of "fact “SanwFrancisco Bay Ex-
position.”

Twelve thousand replies in a name
selection contest certainly are ample
evidence of the great local interest be-
ing taken in San Francisco’s promotion
of a World’s Fair. ‘Lo-cal sons are rally-
ing; local pride is rising.

Indicative of this home—town attitude
is the statement by Brigadier—General
H. H. Arnold, Assistant Chief of the
United StatesArmy Air Corps. Said
he, while in San Francisco recently on
a ﬂying inspection of the Paciﬁc Coast
air bases: “The San Francisco Bay re—
gion is destined to be one of the World’s
foremost aviation centers, and the 1939
World’s Fair has an unprecedented op—
portunity to show the modern progress
of civil and military aeronautics.” To
Fair promoters this meant just one
thing: Federal interest in the Exposi—
tion’s development. 1

Francisco Bay should start the ball roll-
ing t0ward the greatest aeronautical
pageant in history, to be held in con-
junction with the 1939 International
Exposition, and its major theme——
Transportation. Spectacular mobile and
static displays of commercial and mili-
tary ﬂying, the National Air Races, and
international ﬂying meets, should pro-
vide attraction for millions of visitors.”

“It is possible,” the Brigadier—Gen-
eral continued, “that with well—laid
plans the U; S. Army Air Corps may
hold its “annualwmaneuvers in the San.

rancisco Bay area in Exposition year.

The World’s Fair site, which will be—
come San Francisco’s ofﬁcial airdrome
following the Fair period, deserves a
ﬁtting tribute in the way of dedication
that will herald its opening to the world.
I should like to see San Francisco Bay
Region and the 1939 World’s Fair ac—
cord the modern progress of aviation its
rightful place in the sun.” ‘

Important as the Brigadier-General’s
remarks were, chief interest to outsiders
lay in the obvious fact that California
promoters aren’t “missing a trick” in
selling the 1939 venture to the world.
'With New York planning a similar ex-
position in 1939, it can be expected that
the press will be full of glowing reports,
that each organization will attempt to
outdo the other in magniﬁcence, origin—
ality and exhibits.

New York

Despite the scope of activities that

,, the._,..San _,Francisco -Exposition un~

doubtedly will undertake, there is abso-
lutely no reason to believe that the New
York World’s Fair Committee is let—
ting any grass grow under its feet.
Some of the biggest “names” in archi-
tectural circles got together recently
with George McAneny, Chairman of
the Board of the World’s Fair, and there
was plenty of evidence that this group
does not plan to be outdone.

Present at the meeting were Percy S.
Strauss, chairman of the World’s Fair
architectural committee; Stephen F.
Voorhees, chairman of the board of de—
sign; Edwin F arnham Greene, head of
the Fair committee of the textile indus-
try; Lewis Mumford, critic; Gilbert
Rohde, director of the PWA design
laboratory; Henry Wright, city planner
and Fellow of the A. I. A.; Caleb Horn-
bostel and Albert Mayer architects;
Ned H. Dearborn and Harvey W.

University; and Harvey Wiley Corbett,
