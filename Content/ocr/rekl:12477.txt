[Letter]

Nov 21st 22

Miss Julia Morgan, Archt.
Merchants exchange Bldg.
San Francisco, Cal.

Dear Miss Morgan:-

It surely is laughable how things get twisted and exaggerated.  Yesterday Mr. Lee and a party came to visit the job; Mr. Tomkins showed them around,  later Mr. Lee came to me and in a joshing way asked me to show him what was left of the Bldg. after the storm; he was very nice, and after having seen everything, how the concrete was mixed, and how nicely everything was, and the straightness of the forms, he said: - "You know Mr. Rossi.  I have just come down from San Francisco, and I tell you these people up there sure have the wrong idea of the effects of the late storm; they think the whole building was blown over and they insisted that with concrete and all it was tilted over.  I assured them that no concrete had been poured in the upper walls, but they wanted their own way and said that the lower walls were poured and those were surely thrown over." and, Lee added", can you imagine walls this thick:(spreading his arms wide,) and underground to be hurt any?"

This goes to show how misinformation spreads; he further stated that most of our windows had been blown in, he was told, and other unfavorable comments.

To the contrary you know that even though the storm raged impetuously, there was but little damage done; in the Main Blgd. in spite of our precautions the front forms were slightly thrown out of plumb, even though they had been braced with timbers on the leeward side and three steel cables on the windward; this damage however did not amount over $300.00 to repair.


The concrete placing is going ahead in fine shape, we only beg to get about 100 sacks of hydrated lime and some 500 bbls of cement on this next boat.  I wired to this effect yesterday, as an urgent reminder to our order of a few days ago.

Your letter of the 16th, announcing your arrival was received yesterday.

Kindest regards.

Sincerely yours.
s/Rossi
