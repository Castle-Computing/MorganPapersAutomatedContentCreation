Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mailed you last night the various bath arrangement for houses B and C main floors as originally proposed, also new layout for House b.

Below space under baths if built out would give more light in lower bedrooms but would not add much to attraction of larger rooms on account of existing main construction walls.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
