Mr. Loorz:

	Nothing on the Hill except the concrete -- 
and not always that -- is built to resist these
winter storms. The stone columns are marble
standards in the gardens blow down. They need
stronger iron ties and more firmly fixed bases. The 
lamp globes blow off. They need to screw on to the 
standards. The ordinary catches simply don't hold. 

	The windows in the house all leak. Even 
the double windows leak -- and leak in rivers. The 
windows are simply not weather proof. They are not 
tight. They are summer windows and we have to 
contend with winter. We will have to completely 
reconstruct the window protection and on an entirely 
different basis. Each window of a double window must
be heavy enough and strong enough and tight enough 
and scientifically designed enough to resist these 
storms. Then the double windows will doubly resist 
them.

	That is the only way. There is no use in 
trying to compromise. Furhermore, every year before
winter, the windows -- and doors where exposed - must 
be tested by having the fire hose played on them.
Ther is no use trying to live in lath houses --
or bath houses.

	Then there is the question of chimney tops --
and chimney plaves. The rain cascades down the
present chimneys. Of course the hurricane just comes 
down these chimneys and lives with you. We must have
chimneys with roofs and slits so that the rain can be 
kept out and the draft helped by the wind. 

	I will not go into every detail. but the 
houses must be made livable in winter -- especially
as we spend the summer in Wyntoon and San Simeon
is a winter residence. 

	Lets reconstruct on a winter basis.
	
	Sincerely,
