February 25, 1927.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Amb assador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
To add the studio on the north wing would be virtually the addition of a third story. Would it not unbalance the patio? A third story on the south also would be practically on a line with those of the Main Building.
Could the studio be housed in the Chinese Hill group. or possibly in the Tennis Court development?
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
