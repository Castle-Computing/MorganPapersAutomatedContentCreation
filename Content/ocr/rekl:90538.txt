Miss Julia Morgan, 
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Miss Morgan:

	I hope you have a great time.
I am sure you will. 

	Certainly I would like to make 
such a trip myself, but I guess I will have to 
stay here and try to make enough money to put up 
another house -- or to finish those already begun. 

Sincerely, 
WR Hearst
