Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

By using all of the beds here of all types except three (the satin canopy bed from Mrs. Hearst's room, the very heavy English wooden canopy bed and the black inlay English bed) we will still be one bed short of the number needed to furnish the new bedrooms of Houses A and C, and the eight cloister bedrooms - twelve beds in all.  There is one on the Tolentino sale list which would be good if it could be sent out.

Unless I hear from you to the contrary I will have the necessary mattresses, etc. made as almost all of them are  very special in size and  cut.

As to the bureaus -- if you would send out the little chest of drawers, etc. marked in the Tolentino sale catalogue returned to you by mail two days ago there will be plenty for all the new rooms.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
