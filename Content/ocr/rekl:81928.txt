Dear Miss Morgan:

We must go rather lightly on construction at the ranch during May because Mrs. Hearst 
wants a lot done on the Sands Point residence in New York and I can't afford heavy 
construction on the two localities.

I expect to go to the ranch tonight and will be there until Sunday night.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
