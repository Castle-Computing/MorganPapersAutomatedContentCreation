COPY TO MISS MORGAN-

March 23, 1921.

Mr. J. B. Lee,
San Simeon, Calif.

Dear Mr. Lee:

Mr. Hearst is ordering a lot of plants and seeds which are being  shipped from different concerns to the ranch. In each case I have  requested them to mark the package or case "Las Estrellas," in  addition to the necessary address to reach the ranch.  

"Las Estrellas" is the name decided upon my Mrs. Hearst for the  hill-top.  

You will know, therefore, that any cases or packages arriving and  marked "Las Estrellas" are for use in connection with the hill-top  development. I am sending a copy of this letter to Miss Morgan so  that she will understand.  

Will you kindly find out from her just where she will want you to  locate these packages after they reach the ranch.

Sincerely yours,
s/ J Willicombe
Secretary to Mr. Hearst.
