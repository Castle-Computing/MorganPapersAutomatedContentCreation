Dear Miss Morgan:

You are right about terrace wall and the trees.  As a matter of fact, however, I do not believe the Italian cypress can stay in this location on account of the wind.  They are being blow to pieces, and in addition they do not look healthy.

We will probably have to confine the Italian cypress to the north side where it is protected.  Those on that side seem to be doing well.

2.  It is excellent idea to use the red damask for the theatre.  This saves a lot of money and will make a beautiful theatre.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
