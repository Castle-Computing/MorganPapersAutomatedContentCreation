Dear Mr. Hearst

It is perfectly feasible to do as you suggest and build now the dining room, kitchen, pantry in the basement, also the billiard room annex, - and the bed rooms next summer.  The dining room set has been attended to.

If you will let me know the day that will best suit your convenience, I will plan for it.

Yours very truly,
