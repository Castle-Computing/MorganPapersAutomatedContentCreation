November 10, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Hotel Ambassador,
Los Angeles, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is the latest from the Bynes, - Also the magazine article he spoke of sending.  Those mantels look interesting, being so different in scale from the Italian ones - but probably he would have mentioned them if they had been obtainable.

The housing question came up again today in the ample form of Mrs. Kincaid who called to ask if you had said where and how Mr. Kincaid and herself were to be housed, feed, etc. at San Simeon.  As I could not tel her, it ended in my promising to tell you of her inquiries.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
