Dear Miss Morgan:

No, please do not start the plaster experiment on the social room walls.  I am in hopes 
that the present treatment will be generally improved and will remain.  I think the 
present treatement satisfied Miss Morgan.  If I am mistaken in this we will try other 
experiments.

2.  In regard to the silver screen at the Ranch, I would say that the radical movie 
equipment changes have already developed.  That is to say, the large screen is now an 
established fact and will soon be in general operation.  I doubt very much if there 
will be any particular modification of the size and general character of this screen.  
At any rate, we will make the screen to fill completely the procenium arch and certainly
 it can be made no larger than that.

Under these circumstances it would seem to me desirable and convenient to have the 
screen go down through the stage floor rather than slide it back to the rear wall.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
