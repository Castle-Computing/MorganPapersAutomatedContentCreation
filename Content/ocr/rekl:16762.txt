Miss Julia Morgan;
San Francisco Cal.
Dear Miss Morgan:-
Mr. Hearst and party left on last tuesday night. Herewith you will find a copy of his instructions, on the hall mantel flue, the billiard room etc. he also said for you to get the House keeper you had originally tried to get... perhaps you may get here by offering her more money. He wants storm doors to be made 2 1/4" thick for all openings to decks for the three cottages.
Yours very truly,
