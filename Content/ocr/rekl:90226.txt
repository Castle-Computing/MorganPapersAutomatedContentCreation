Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Miss Morgan:

May I urge PARTICULARLY  that the flues in the new rooms be made large enough for the 
big fireplaces, so that we don not have to ruin the effect of the fireplaces by cutting 
them down to fit the flues.

It is better to spend money now to get the fires right rather than to spend much more 
later for  less satisfactory job.

We have so many fireplaces and so much trouble that I consider this matter one of the 
really important things in connection with the comforts of the Hacienda.

Sincerely yours,
s./WR Hearst
