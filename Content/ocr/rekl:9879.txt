Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your letter in regard to changing the roofs of the houses arrived several days ago.

I have been thinking into the detail, and have had the best practical information obtainable here.  If the ceilings were not tied with ropes of fibre and gypsum to the roof joists and trusses, (following old world practice), it would be a simple matter to take off the roofs, have the iron trusses, etc. ready, and re-roof, although at great risk of wetting the ceiling in pouring the concrete roof slabs.  As it is, the wooden joists, etc. cannot be taken out and replaced without wrecking the ceilings to greater or less extent.

The roof slab of concrete would be more fireproof but little more waterproof  than the boards, as both depend on the asphalt and felt material mopped on covering, for waterproofness, the tile only being a help in either case and not dependable.

I will have all ready by summer and make the effort to change to iron and concrete if you think best, but as a much less dangerous alternative, would it not meet all danger from storms, if the present tile were taken off, the roofs covered with three or four more ply of asphalt and mathoid very carefully put on, the whole recovered with specially made heavier tile, cemented on.  The present framing is sufficient to carry this extra load--and a certain amount of extra bracing could be done for good measure.  So far as I could see 
or learn  there has been no roof leaks in any of the houses.  There was an extra layer (over the ordinary practice) of roofing put on in the start.  The flying tile are dangerous and might do regrettable damage, aside from the trouble and cost of replacing even a few each winter.

The only variety of sash that positively have not leaked at all are the reversible wooden sash in the big windows, and the little opening out sash in the towers of C.  Lots of windows have never leaked, but some of each of all the other kinds have.

As always

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
