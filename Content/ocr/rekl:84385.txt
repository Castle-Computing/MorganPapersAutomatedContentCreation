June 15th, 1931

Dear Mr. Hearst:

There is a question on the Neptune Pool needing you decision.  The large pool pitches 
from feet deep at low end to feet at deep end.  We agreed to lower the ladies' pool 
to depth of large pool not thinking of this.

Would you make the new bottom like this in contact at "A", or would you keep the bottom 
of the ladies' pool up a couple of feet at this point "B"?


Electricians and plumbers are busy rearranging the mass of wires and pipes back of 
the Gothic bath rooms to allow the extensions to the baths and the revamped celestial 
stair work to proceed.

The steel truss and girders for the South Tower went down last boat, and all 
furniture and treasures from the library lobby back to the patio are safely out 
and stored.  Animal Hill grading has been going on steadily, also work on the 
"grottos."

It rained here all Sunday and Sunday night - such extraordinary June weather!  
We will put off unroofing as long as possible.  We will put back the same plumbing
fixtures in the Gothic baths, but it would be nice later to have broad marble slab 
basins in the dressing room sections.

I hope you are having a joyful rest.  As always

Yours very truly,
