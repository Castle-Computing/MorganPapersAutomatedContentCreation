Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you for your letter enclosing Mr. Addison's estimates of amount of required fencing for the new animal enclosures.  We get bids on the wire fencing and so on the posts - in quantity lots - and order as soon as possible.  The animals do look very picturesque and interesting as seen unexpectedly grouped here and there.  Now if you could come on the lions for instance, as unexpectedly, it would produce a real thrill.

Sincerely yours,
