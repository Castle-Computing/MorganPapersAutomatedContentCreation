Dear Mr. Hearst:

What you say in regard to heating by steam at (1) San Simeon - is true.  The location 
of pipes and radiators for the main story rooms is quite simple. I allowed originally 
for steam piping to the Gothic and Celestial tower rooms, but had to use up the pipe 
space later for bell conduits when the chimes console was located off the billiard 
rooms, instead of in the library lobby as at that time planned.  With the bells out 
of the towers, the pipe ducts will be free again to fulfill their original purpose.  
The general layout has always been in mind, but at that, there are many individual
 problems.

(2)  If you approve, we can try what seems the most accurately responsive devices in 
the way of direct radiation thermostatic control at Wyntoon this year, and you can 
judge their efficiency vs. general room control thermostats - for the other 
installations.

(3)  The tennis court posts might be treated as a form of pergola.  Will try some 
sketches on the new suggestions it opens.  It will be fine to present a finished 
appearance from the West Terrace to and around the tennis courts.

(4) Yesterday I had the treat of placing your Spanish and Italian majolica collections 
in the Study, and used all but one piece -- to small and fine to see just how to handle
 -- and also, placed all the articles we took out except those destined by nature and 
 source for Wyntoon.  I hope you will like the effect -- also changed rugs and keyed 
 up, Cloister Rooms #1 and #2.
 
 Very truly yours
