Mr. William Rendoloh Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City.

Dear or. Hearst:

. Although I had my bag and ticket.reedy

lest night for Sen Simeon, a last minute telegram put
of? the trio, as tho roads were resorted practically
impossible, five or six inches of rain having fallen
in as many days.‘ ' g '

_ By taking advantage of the December good
weather for pushing the concrete work, all the sell
steos, etc. ere in excoot the pavement in connection
with the main terrace and tho.motivo in front of "B"
below the oak; ~- a sketch for Which is enclosed. Now
¥if we can get our tile oeoolo to just hurry tile elong
a bit, Hadley will have clear sailing for some months.

I am sending you by this mail a "Loan
Collection" -— the one of the Byne~€tapley garden photo-
grerhs Which arrived yesterday. The Sorelle garden one
might o€Yer e suggestion for :he finish at the foot of
the "A" terrace steps toward the Butterfly. Hazzerd
thinks oensies would be about the only thing to make the
Butterfly of. I have my fears regerdine it, on‘eccount
of the amount of sunshine that plot gets on a hot day.
By outlining the creature in box, the form at least would
always be there, and could be refilled. It might possibly
be that after the box odgeing grow sufficiently it would
not be necessary to mete the color of the flowers ~- just
using rose bushes, etc., as in menyglf these Spanish
examples. - if” ”
