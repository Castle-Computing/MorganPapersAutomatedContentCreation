December 22, 1921.

Mr. William Rendoloh Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Although I had my bag and ticket reedy
last night for Sen Simeon, a last minute telegram put
off the trip, as the roads were reported practically
impassible, five or six inches of rain having fallen
in as many days.

By taking advantage of the December good
weather for pushing the concrete work, all the wall
steps, etc. are in except the pavement in connection
with the main terrace and the motive in front of "B"
below the oak; -- a sketch for which is enclosed. Now
if we can get our tile people to just hurry tile along
a bit, Hadley will have clear sailing for some months.

I am sending you by this mail a "Loan
Collection" -- the one of the Byne-Stapley garden photo-
graphs which arrived yesterday. The Sorella garden one
might offer e suggestion for the finish at the foot of
the "A" terrace steps toward the Butterfly. Hazzard
thinks pansies would be about the only thing to make the
Butterfly of. I have my fears regarding it, on account
of the amount of sunshine that plot gets on a hot day.
By outlining the creature in box, the form at least would
always be there, and could be refilled. It might possibly
be that after the box edgeing grew sufficiently it would
not be necessary to make the color of the flowers -- just
using rose bushes, etc., as in many of these Spanish
examples.

Yours Sincerely, 
JM-L
Encs.
