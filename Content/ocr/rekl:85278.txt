Dear Miss Morgan:

I enclose photographs of three Gothic mantels which Mr. Brummer will negotiate for 
upon his arrival in Paris soon.

As I remember the dimensions of the mantels they were larger than Mr. Brummer says. 
 Anyhow they are large enough for the big room and I hope Brummer gets them.

Sincerely yours,
