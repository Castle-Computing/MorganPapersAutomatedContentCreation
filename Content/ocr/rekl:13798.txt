Dear Miss Morgan,

If you remember you spoke of planting dwarf forest trees in that space between the high fence that was and the permanent roadway from west of Peach Orchard to near the white gate.

I wish to draw your attention to the fact that if such a plan is final we should put our order in for them at once as there is always a shortage of Dwarf Stock, last year we sent in our order for the stock to Van Dusen nurseries.  Geneva N.Y. in the first week of sept and at that early date we were too late to secure what we needed, so this year let us get our order in sooner.

I would appreciate a reply form you giving me your plans and ideas in this matter.

Thanking you, with Kindest regards,
Yours V.Respectfully
