V A8 econ as the roede are usable for the machines,
' ﬁr; Clark has arranged for me to go down with 3r. Ribony
end show him the work. i

I had not understood from your letter thet the
change one to be more then one of local euperintendence,
but no I understand ﬁr. Clark, I am to be relieved of
all except strictly architectural services ~~ Mehony Droe.
to do all the work we have done no to now except nrovid»
ing plane and specifications and giving a reeeoneble n—
mount of time to interpreting theee. In many ways this
will be a relief, as no one but myself knows the time eon
attention it has taken to round out and bring together
the.verioue physical and personcl_olemente -~ the plceenrc
an& interest in the work being the chief recompense. ~~
our commission of 85% not yielding a pro? t of more the

in over actual costs to no, not in itself o very neyine
proposition. ' " »

I do not now see just how the new‘schene will work
out. ,The buildings proper have always been e commerc-
tively simple matter -- it is the special work from the
time the frame is no, on, tnet is ai93icnlt to hennle.
olf¥it is not just right your Viollet-le-Euc eye is not
eetisfiec, and to do the work to meet your enprovel (and
mine incidentally) requires ertiate' work and the bendi—
ing of more or less temncreme.tnl people. if these oeople
are chosen by some one elee, or i? chosen by you, or ny~
self, one are under the direction of 3 general contract-
, or, -- there is every chance ior friction and misunder-
standing. ihat is why I told Mr. ﬁlerk it would be nee-w
eeeary to make very clear the various reoooneibilitiee.
