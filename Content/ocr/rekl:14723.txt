July 7, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

 I did not know Mr. Rossi had dismissed anyone you had employed and am very sorry.  He lacks tact in handling men, on the one side, -- while his insistence on all men under him working is not popular.  I have tried to get him to see just what he lacks, but it is too much born in him for him to understand and his efforts at being tactful were so amusing I gave up.

I have just received your several telegrams so will not write anything until you tell me the arrangement you have in mind.

The photographs just received show lots of fine things - am delighted with them.

I will gather up the various terrace and other studies and bring them and the pool studies Saturday night.

Yours very truly,
