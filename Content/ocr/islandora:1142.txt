Mr. William Randolph Hearst, 
Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This morning I arrived back from San Simeon.  Mr. Washburn as you know is not spectacular by he has done really good work in getting things substantially started;  this means  that to date he has the foundation of all the houses under way, the forms for Cottage "B" up to the first story and forms for Cottage "C" well under way.  He has plenty of laborers of a good class and is confident of holding them.  Carpenters who were engaged last week and who were supposed to be there the last of the last week or the first of this have not shown up, but I feel that good men can be had by the end of the week using modification of your generous offer as a basis.

It has rained a couple of days and the road which had been in very good shape was almost impassable again although Mr. Lee had men working on it. Even a little rainfall causes the bank to fall over the road way.

I have been fore-handed in the question of ordering material, but cannot be absolutely certain of delivery.  No boats have stopped at San Simeon since Jan. 17th, and the Pacific Steamship Company claim their new boat on the run is too large to put in at your wharf.  Also much of the material is not here in California, such as glass, hardware, tile, etc., and not orders based on delivery date will be accepted.  I am only sure that the houses will be usable.  It was perfectly lovely up there yesterday after the rain. I wished you and Mrs. Hearst could have been there.

The trucks you ordered, for which Mr. Bogart I am sure, has made every effort, have not materialized, and it is out of the question to try any expensive hauling, as you warned me before, from San Luis Obispo.

I am arranging for things like tile to be taken on to Los Angeles and sent up by tramp coaster, but I do not want to bother you with these small problems except to let you know how things stand.

Yours Sincerely,
