Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, California

May 30, 1935.

Dear Miss Morgan:

When the west wall is finished, we may want to consider extension of the south wall 
from the west wall around in front of House A.

That southwest corner needs to be finished up.  It is about the only part of the 
grounds that is still something of a jungle.

There is no hurry about this wall, but I think we should be considering it.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan
San Francisco, Calif.
