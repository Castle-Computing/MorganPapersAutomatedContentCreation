Dear Miss Morgan:

In order to avoid all possible delays when we begin work in the sprint -- say about the middle of March -- let us use the winter months to store material in the warehouses at San Simeon.  We can accumulate a lot of cement and all the iron work that is necessary -- everything in fact that we are going to need during the summer months.

We should only suspend construction on the hill, because construction cannot proceed economically or efficiently during the period of the storms; but we should progress with everything else -- the making of tiles and whatever woodwork and plaster work and iron sort is necessary and can be done in San Francisco or elsewhere and have everything shipped during the winter months and stored in the warehouse so that as soon as the roads are fit for trucking from San Simeon to the hill we can begin work and proceed rapidly without having to wait for ANYTHING.

In the meanwhile we can proceed with the planting and the completion of the fences as already outlined, and early in the spring we can mend the roads, and get ready for the construction work s soon as possible.

I wrote you about painting the exposed ironwork.  Perhaps the best thing to paint it with is paint.  That will surely protect it.

You asked me about putting burlap around the Jacarandas and whether I am willing to take that much trouble.  I certainly am.  I think it desirable to protect all the delicate trees this way, including the orange trees, until they get ample start.  It is doubtful whether some of these will grow under the most favorable conditions, but we must provide the most favorable conditions.

I telegraphed about planting the windbreaks as Mr. Keep desires, and says quite truly I consented to.  I am willing to have eucalyptus trees wherever they are the best for windbreaks.  Other good trees to plant are fig trees, walnut trees, olive trees and alligator pear trees.  The only thing I am anxious to avoid, as I have written, is planting high trees where they will obscure the view.  There is nothing better for windbreaks than eucalyptus, and I suppose the flower of eucalyptus is as good as any for practical purposes and more interesting picturesquely.

But of course the figs, alligator pears, walnut, grape fruit, etc. are a little more useful, and I would like to see them freely planted in all available spots around the houses.  Olives will grow on rocks or anything so they are available for places.  I am still hoping to come out west, but probably now not until after the holidays.

Sincerely, s/WR Hearst
