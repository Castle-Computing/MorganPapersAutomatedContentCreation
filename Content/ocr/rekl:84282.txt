Dear Mr. Hearst:

There is a set of dining room furniture in San Francisco Bekin's you bought for the 
boys' Berkeley house.  Could this be loaned for the Taylor's rooms,- or is it too good?

Can the many trunks of Indian material be shipped to San Simeon and go in one of the 
new store rooms?  Also the pictures, and the collections of fine china and glass.  
One moving van will probably take only the indian material and pictures.

Yours truly,
