Our various handsome candelabra are very crudely and ineff-
ectively treated in adapting them to electric lights,the work
having apparently been done by the local electrician,who has no
sufficent idea of how this should be done,

I advise that this work do done by the best firm on the
coast —- someone as nearly like CaldWell of New York as possible.

This applies to all candelabra ,but immediately to the
two in main assembly room on either side of fireplace,and to the
four in the dining room. 1

I would prefer to have the firm send down hen here to
make the necessary drawings and to fit the additions when they
are ready. If this cannot be done we can ship the candelabra
bet I do not like to ship them if this can be avoided.

The very crude application-of the candles and the very
primitive method of turning on the lights deprive the candel—
abra of all possible artistic effect and even of the best

' lighting effect. '

‘The candelabra should be treated in an entirely different
manner and I would like to know what firm is considered.the
best on the coast before the arrangement is made with them,ALSO
IT WOULD BE WEEL FOR THEM To SUBMIT DESIGHS.

While we are about this matter,l think I would like
lamps made out of some jars we have on hand..There are two on
the pianos in the main assembly room,and two others on the
south side of that room, '

 

I have just thought we can solve-our whole problem > .
regarding the fireplace in the east lobby by shifting it to
the south side of the room where I think it naturally belongs.
Back of the fireplace on the south side there is merely a pantry
across which we could run the flue at a low angle without
doing any damage to it.
After it had crossed the sentry it could go on across the
light well on the second-story and go up the outside of the new ._ ‘
servants‘ quarters,and above them to a considerable height so as ‘* g
’to keep the smoke clear from the third story of the main house. J
This would give us a good incline at every stage of the
flue and it would not interfere with the architectural cement;
uction,as it Would if a similar course were taken by the flue
on the north side. -

I think this solves the problem and we only have the small trouble of taking down the fireplace and re-erecting it on the other side.

That is not as much trouble as trying to make a flue under the difficulties that beset us on the north side.

[handwritten note]

It was finally agreed not to move the mantel to the South wall but to leave it where it is - take out the dressing rooms extending the Billiard Rm to the existing M.B. wall - The small lavatory will be large enough - then you can raise the projection room enough to put another lavatory there.
