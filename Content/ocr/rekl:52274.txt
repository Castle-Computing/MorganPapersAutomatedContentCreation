Dear Mr. Hearst:

After going over the various San Simeon activities with Mr. Richard Clark, we agreed on the enclosed as a tentative division of responsibilities if acceptable to you.  This would mean that your San Francisco office would do all the ordering and buying we have been handling for orchards, garden and animals, and take care of the pay rolls and running expenses incident to carrying on the work.

Last year these activities cost you for labor and materials about $29,750.00.  We have not been able to pay up all old nursery bills yet - but can do so from the next two months' budgets.

Mr. Keep's and Mr. Macklin's orders for winter and spring planting already placed amount to about $6500.00.  These we will pass to Mr. Clark as the material will not be delivered or bills be payable for some time yet.

Yours very truly,
