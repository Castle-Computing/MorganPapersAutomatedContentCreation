Mr. William Randolph Hearst
137 Riverside Drive
New York, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you for sending me enclosed letter from the Metropolitan Museum.  Evidently "C' has a natural habit of attracting the most interesting to herself.

What a very pleasant inscription! It fits in so well with the fell of the Arab columns.

Yours Sincerely
