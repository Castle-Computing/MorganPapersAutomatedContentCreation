(Letterhead: Hotel Alexandria, Los Angeles)

Dear Miss Morgan,

In thinking over the lower terraces or gardens for the bungalows I conclude gardens would be better as we will want to grow some vines and flowers over the lower parts of the houses especially over house A.

We should not advance the wall of the terrace of house A too far away from the house on account 
of the steepness of the hill there.  We could extend it pretty well to the sides and turn it back at the ends.  I think there should be some monumental jars or figures on pedestals in the middle of the front sustaining wall as we want to take away or obscure the bareness of the lower part of the house.

With house B we can make the terrace deeper  
and build out a square directly in front as you suggested.  This house can stand more terrace because the house itself is not already high and because the hill is not so steep here.

I have been wondering whether a sustaining wall running all the way around in front of the three houses would be good but perhaps three separate terraces would be better.
I will be in San Francisco Tuesday and will see you about these things.

You might have some rough sketches made and when we go down to San Simeon again we can see how they apply.

Sincerely,
s/ W. R. Hearst
