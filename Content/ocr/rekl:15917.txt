Dear Mr. Hearst:

I.	The blue prints of the Beach House are not of course a complete set of plans, but should enable the builders to go ahead without doing over main framing to accommodate chimneys, hearths, pipes, trusses, etc. on upper floors.

You may not like the roof or other details of treatment, but they are easily changed.  We will go right on completing and in a few days, would like to go over the whole set with you -- or could send Mr. Joy if preferred.

II.	Am mailing with this your door trims warehoused here or at San Simeon, the locations are noted on backs of photographs.

III.	There is a large quantity of material in storage here you evidently will not use at once.  Much of it, such as stone mantels, iron grilled, statuary, china and glass could safely be stored in galvanized iron covered store houses, -- located perhaps most economically for re-shipment purposes down at San Simeon, where the truck could be run from the wharf right into the warehouse aisles, obviating any but the disembarking handling and so on re-shipping south or north by boat - again.

As for the furniture, on account of the difficulty of keeping out field mice, rats, bats, etc. and the too great changes in temperature, due to the sheet metal covering, my eyes over the last years would say it would be better to house in substantial and thoroughly weather proof walls and roofs.

Yours very truly,
