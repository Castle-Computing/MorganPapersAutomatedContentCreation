Dear ﬁr; Hearat:

Aieatarday I had a pleaaant walk along the
oampletaa ridge pbla of the main building root. The
View is "Great" and the lovely nlear weather allowu
ad ona to 933 wayyuplnnd down the coast. The roof
pour was complqted~Pr1aay. and the concrete in fine
snaps. It still has to be ﬁmootheuoated and it will
need to be kapt wet for ten ta taurteen days. The
concrete will be than ooretad with.an aeyhalt and
We aan~
not lay tha tile safely until the towers are u§.but
they have been mpecially made by a L08 Angelea firm
and are ready. .

The ltbrary forma.are all down nmd the room
is a lovely ona even ncw «w the preportlnna and win»
ﬂaws Just r1ght.!or the purpoaa. - ‘

The last at Mr. Van der.Loa’s.oaata for the
main room ceiling were finiaheﬁ a waek ago and have
arrived on Tap. have not shipped up the antique
portion yat. as the building naoessarlly has to be
kept wet. WE will be ahead of pragram as far «a thei
atrnbture 1a aonoernai by.Christmnsg but It looks tau
day a3 inaugh 1t Wuuld not be safe £0 gut up any calla
Saga until after the holidays on aaanunt af the wetu,
tness of tha great generate beama.

@he imperial Butte extra height has certainly
twpnoved the front elavatinns and the masa 9f the whole
building a3 aaan tram tha highway. (

I have oraered monelmatal tanks fer the towers
and tin aoated brass pipe for the water suppliea aftar -
