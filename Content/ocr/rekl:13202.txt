Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York,
Dear Mr. Hearst:
Yesterday I had a pleasant walk along the complete ridge pole of the main building roof. The view is "Great" and the lovely clear weather allow-ed one to see way up and down the coast, The roof pour was completed Friday, and the concrete in fine shape. It still has to be smoothecoated and it will need to be kept wet for ten to fourteen days. The concrete will be then covered with an asphalt and felt waterproofing before the tile is laid. We can-not lat the tile safely until the towers are up but they have been specially made by a Los Angeles firm and are ready.
The library forms are all down and the room is a lovely on even now -- the proportions and win-dows just right for the purpose.
The last of Mr. Van der Loo's casts for the main room ceiling were finished a week ago and have arrived on Top. I have not shipped up the antique portion yet, as the building necessarily has to be kept wet. We will be ahead of program as far as the structure is concerned by Christmas, but it looks to-day as though it would not be safe to put up any ceil-ings until after the holidays on account of the wet-tness of the great concrete beams.
The imperial suite extra height has certainly improved the front elevations and the mass of the whole building as seen from the highway.
I have ordered monelmetal tanks for the towers and tin coated brass pipe for the water supplies after a thorough investigation of various experiences with similar water conditions, and a series of chemical ex-periments by the University of California laboratories Mr. Hearst,
November 12, 1923.

at Berkeley, of all kinds, using all available mater-
ials and our water samples.

The gardens are being prepared for winter,
but are still full of lovely blooms.

Yours very truly;

JM-deM
