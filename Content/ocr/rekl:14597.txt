NEW YORK AMERICAN

April 11, 1925.

My Dear Mr. Hale:

Miss Morgan tells me of your kindness and I am deeply appreciative.

I know, too, that in addition to your friendship for me you are prompted by a desire to see beautiful mementos of the Exhibition preserved and employed in a fitting manner.

I assure you that your wishes in this regard will be respected to the utmost, and that the models and art works that you are good enough to entrust to us will be employed not only on my place in San Simeon, where they will be largely open to public inspection, but in some of the various plans that I have for memorial buildings in the University of California.

At all times I will be glad to give due credit to the artists who have created these wonderful works, and to the care and foresight of yourself and the other members of the Exposition Committee who have so thoughtfully preserved them.

With renewed thanks, I am,

Faithfully yours,

(Signed) W.R. Hearst
