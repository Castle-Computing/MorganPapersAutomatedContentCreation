Dear Mr. Hearst:

The polo and flying field sounds interesting.  Would they be located on the level this side of the old adobe?

As to the Sanco Pojo and Burnett houses - how much would you think reasonable to spend on them?

The first San Simeon house to date has cost $3008.00 and it will not cost more than $1500.00 to complete, allowing $500.00 for unforseens. As reported before, we used the Hill sash which helped quite a little, and Mr. Smith, the San Luis Obispo contractor, has proved a careful manager.

You will be perhaps amused to hear that I had an opportunity to talk about Hill life with Mr. Cardini, the marble man, and Mr. Rankin, the plumber, and lead the chat around to the subject of Mr. Rossi's hospitality.  Each waxed enthusiastic in describing Mrs. Rossi's cookery!  "But does not having so much company make it quite expensive for the Rossi's?"  "Oh no, the cook on the Hill gives Mr. Baldwin our portion of dinner and Mrs. Rossi cooks it for us."

The frank quickness of the two answers showed that no question of dishonesty in connection with it had occured to either of them.  Mr. Rankin added that as he did not want to be under obligations to Mr. Rossi, he always was careful to bring up enough in the way of "treats" for the family to offset anything he might consume.

When present excitements have quieted down, shall I find a natural way to take the question up and stop the practice?  The danger is that what was started as a petty economy, may have developed into a regular habit and in any case sets a question-

Yours very truly,
