MR W.R. HEARST,
137 RIVERSIDE DRIVE,
NEWYORK CITY, N.Y.

RAIMONDA RUIZ CILING STORED SAFELY.  ON ITS RECEIPT I IMAGINED YOU INTENDED TO PLAN THE ALHAMBRA TO FIT IT, MAKING ONE LONG ROOM ACROSS FRONT WITH DOMICAL PAVILIONS AT ENDS BUT LIKE THE DOME IN CENTER BETTER FOR EXZTERIOR EFFECT OF WHOLE HILL GROUPING.  REGARDING STAINED BLASS WINDOWS DO NOT THINK THEY FIT INTO PRESENT WORK.  AM LEAVING FOR SAN SIMEON AND WIL TELEGRAPH AS TO TIME NEEDED IF WE DO HOUSE C BATHS NOW.

SIGNED
JULIA MORGAN.
