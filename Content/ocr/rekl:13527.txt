Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

When at the Hill ten days ago I went down rough the orchards and citrus plantings with Mr. Keep.  Both are in very fine shape and only two trees of these plantings were lost this winter.  "Samples" of oranges, tangerines, kumquats and pomelos are of fine quality and Mr. Keep asks me to tell you he thinks the "quality" is assured.

Both Mr. Keep and Mr. Webb have worked hard and well - but with both of them the water question has become an obsession.  Given the season, it seems necessary to get at least the full reservoir water for the Hill as soon as possible.

[Margin Notes]
All right and make the reservoir large enough this time.

In this connection, we have at last a proposition from the San Joaquin LIght & Power Company, using the State Railway Commission as  a lever, that seems reasonable.  Briefly it is that you pay the cost of the extension of the line on public property to San Simeon at cost -- ( a limit to this cost being $11,00) -- and that they will return the entire sum at the rate of 20% of your total electric bill (ranch and Hill) per year until the entire $11,00 is returned to you.  It would be necessary for you to put in transformers and distributing lines across you property.  Mr. Phillips is working on the cost of this now -- but says it will not be a very large sum as poles are largely in, -- possible around $4000.

[Margin Notes]
OK. Lets go ahead with this as soon as possible.

On my visit yesterday the whole ranch was green when the week before last year's stubble was still in evidence -- but there is no water a few feet below the surface even in the 
best sections.  It was a lovely day and I wished you could have been there.

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan
