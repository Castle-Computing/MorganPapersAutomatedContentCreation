October 6, 1927.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As agreed Saturday, I saw Mr. Richard Clark as to the new 'Farm Manager'.  Through Mr. Means he located a man who may do -- about forty, born and raised on a big Idaho farm, having grain, herd and fruit products, - later graduating from the engineering department of a mid-west college -- since 1914 on various farm land reclaimation and irregation projects, the latest is Imperial Valley.  Has had charge of engineering project also camps, equipment and men.  Is at present on a farm irregation work at Merced.

Mr. Means recommends him very highly Mr. Clark talked with him and thinks he is as good prospect as is likely to be found.  He is an out door, country (as versus city) type, has a wife and two little boys.  While he has no intimate knowledge of fine Jersey breeding or some of the other 'departments' he evidently has the training to know how to go about acquiring it, also the energy.

He went back to Merced tonight.  I arranged to let him know there if you care to see him.  He could leave his present position on two weeks notice.

Yours very truly,
