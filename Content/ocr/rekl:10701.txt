Mr. William RandoLPh Hearst,

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is a basement layout, also suggestions for stair to Library connections.  The enlarged towers and changed relationships threw out the original scheme.  If the corridor is carried through, it could have simple vaulting in stone and we could use the rest of the vault key-stones you had in mind.  There would be one short, altogether, which could be easily reproduced.  It might be better to have on of the other schemes on account of the corridor serving no special purpose.

The basement purposely has no connections between sections - for fire and thief protection.  If you think this is overdone, there will be time to make openings if you will answer by mail.  I will send next the bed room and Royal Suite layouts.

Work is well under way on the basement excavating - but is slow as the charges of dynamite have to be small.  Mr. Kincaid begins to feel at home, and I have a suspicion, noticing signs, that in a few months his affections will be transferred as his person.  He is bringing over from the Hacienda a couple of trucks and quite an amount of useful small machinery not used there but very helpful on the hill.  He asks me to tell you that he considers things are going very well.

I cannot say how sorry I am to hear of Mr. Barham's death.

Sincerely yours,

JM-deM
Enclo.
