NIGHT LETTER AUG 13 1929

Julia Morgan, Merchants Exchange Bldg., San Francisco, Calif.

As winter house for gatemen is only temporary proposition, I think boards, plus perhaps 
some plaster, would be all right.

2.  A central eating house should be established on lower part of ranch and furthermore 
we should build bunkhouse that we have so long contemplated or something similar.  
Perhaps something spread out would be better than any two-story construction and this 
could be added to easily as required.

3.  I am against gravel in poultry plant, also opposed to too much gardening.  The 
plant should be eminently practical.  I imagine either cement or emulsified asphalt 
would do.  I assume emulsified asphalt is the kind of thing which makes the road south 
of Cambria.

The chicken plant will probably look something like Petaluma with chicken feathers 
flying everywhere; and these do not look good on garden beds.

I think we should depend for decorations on the bells and perhaps an occasional inset 
tile pattern if necessary.

Perhaps the emulsified asphalt being black would make pleasanter contrast with houses 
than to have everything cement.

4.  I think Mr. Rankin better put piping in for Roman bath now.

5.  I think everything should be brought up to Hill as soon as boat arrives, except 
the glass.  I hope the glass has not been sent from San Francisco.  It would better be 
stored there and set down piece by piece as required.  Most of it is going back to New 
York.  How bad is the breakage?
