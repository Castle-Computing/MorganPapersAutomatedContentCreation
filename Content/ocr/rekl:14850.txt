Dear Miss Morgan:

There is one thing that is rather important and that I forgot to talk with you about.

I think instead of putting a salt water bathing pool at the ranch house and pumping the water from the ocean up to the ranch house with some difficulty and expense, it would be better to put a bathing house down on the beach.

I have picked out the place.  It is at the east end of the lagoon on the beach where we go camping.  At this east end there is a flat reef of rocks almost submerged at high tide, but reasonably accessible at other times.

I believe a concrete house could be built right out on these rocks and it would be very interesting and attractive, and that the house could have a big bathing pool just a few feet above the high tide level and into which the water could easily be pumped and where the water could be warmed by means of hot pipes or some such device.

It is absolutely necessary to warm the water, as most of the time, in fact I might say all the time, the ocean water is so cold people will not go into it.

Sincerely

s/ W.R. Hearst
