Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Rossi estimates cost of removing present roof slab girders and steel ties over study at one thousand dollars. Cost of new light steel trusses would be about twenty seven hundred, new concrete slab and clere story about fifteen hundred - totaling say five to six thousand.  From this point on cost for finishing would be about same as room we now have and effect many times as fine.

Yours very truly,
