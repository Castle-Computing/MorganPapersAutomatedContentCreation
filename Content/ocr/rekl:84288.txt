Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards choir stalls, the first lot offered by Mr. Byne were uninteresting and 
plain, and you did not order.

The second were $65,000.00 and were later made a "National Monument." You did not 
order.

The third were a set of painted XIV Century stalls of inferior material and 
workmanship, but interesting on account of the painted Gothic decorations. You did 
not order these.

The fourth was the beautiful set of stalls with "perpendicular" Gothic crestings 
and huge Bishop's escutcheons. These you ordered at $25,000.00, but before Mr. Byne 
could get them out the Bishop died and his successor has not been able to deliver 
them in face of politics in and out of the church.  Mr Byne says it would not be good 
judgment to push the matter at this critical period.

The fifth was the set of Renaissance stalls with carved figures in shallow niche 
panels used in place of the usual cresting.  This set is now in your New York 
warehouse.  

The sixth and last offered is the one of which you enclose photographs.  I agree 
with you that the impression the photographs give does not arouse great enthusiasm - 
the Gothic set you ordered is so wonderfully effective by comparison.

Very truly yours,
