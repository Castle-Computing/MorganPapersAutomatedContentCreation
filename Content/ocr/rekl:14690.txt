June 7, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Owing to the unsettled weather (unusual for May and June) we have not dared make the roof changes or move the warehouse.  Cleaning up, grading, palming, etc. around the Main Building is actively going on, and the material for the tennis court is all on the hill.

We hope this next week to have the unsightly transformers and poles replaced by the underground cable, long ordered and just arrived.

The big room is still dismantled as the wiring and putting up of the ceiling drops has been quite a job in itself.  The side windows are closed up and the marble trims at the end windows are done and are being set in place.  The wainscot for the entire room will take some time to do, but Mr. Supo is making enough to go from the fireplace to the marble doorways on either side so you can see how you like it.

All the work programmed with you for the summer is under way, but proportionately to the money in hand.  Mr. Van der Loo has nearly finished the model for the big doorway and the stone has arrived and is being cut for it, also for the copy of the Sansavino doorway.  The iron work for the cloister is up and the stones are being set, - The ceilings are all up in the cloister bed rooms and are now being eked out as needed in each case to fit the individual room.  I am leaving the doors that are to be used in the help's lodge in these rooms for the present as it would take at least $3000 - $3500 
for the copies we are to make of the antiques, as they will have to be made of wood, carved, - not cast as these were,

Yours very truly,


P.S.  The above is by way of giving you an idea of the status of the work.

It will take until August to finish paying up, which stringing out is fortunately possible due to the Railroad Commission not yet having settled upon the amount we owe the Midlands County Power Company - our last large back account.
