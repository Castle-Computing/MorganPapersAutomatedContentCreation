Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
c/o San Francisco "EXAMINER",
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Mr. Hearst;

Yesterday I mailed you extracts from a letter received from the stately Bynes, in answer to a request for measurements, etc. of the Sanguesa cornice.

1. The Spanish chairs are indoors.

2. Am afraid the drip from the lathed courts would ruin the pavements.  Would not frames like for the Bouganvaillas, set up in front of the more delicate plants, answer the purpose?

3. The edges of the shades now up are frayed already.  I will order some better shade cloth and have it painted as you suggest, and put up with wire guards.

The roof was on "A" before the storm came, although the tile was not on.  No damage was done.

Sincerely yours,
