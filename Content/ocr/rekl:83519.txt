Dear Mr. Hearst:

Today I took the liberty of having rural type phones placed in pantry and Mrs O'Brian's 
room with temporary wiring out to the telegraph office, dead switch board--as otherwise 
there would be no way of reaching the Hill except through Mr. Rossi's office phone.  The
 phones are loaned, so it will allow experiments as to the best solution.

On account of the many studies needed, I will not come to Los Angeles this week, but 
will have some drawings along the lines of each of your suggestions ready by Saturday.

My impression is that locating the Indoor tennis court in front of the plunge would make
 the total mass of the building at this point too bulky for the location.  I see no 
 objection to omitting the fore court, as its old reason for being does not now exist.
   Am wondering if the indoor court could take the place of house D.  If space allows, 
   would you think it good?

Yours very truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
