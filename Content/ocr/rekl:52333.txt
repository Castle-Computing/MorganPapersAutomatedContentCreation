COPY

San Francisco Examiner,
October 24th, 1927.

Dear Mr. Rossi:-

The enclosed copy of letter from Mrs. W.R. Hearst is self-explanatory.

I have been in touch with these people and they will arrive in San Luis Obispo by motor Thursday night and drive out to the ranch Friday morning.  Will you please have someone meet them at the Anderson Hotel Friday morning and direct them to the ranch.  They will just be there for the day and you will, of course, have a lunch prepared for them.  Will you also take them in hand when they arrive on the hill and show them about the place.

Thanking you for any attention you may give these people, I remain,

Sincerely yours,

George Hearst.

My dear Miss Morgan;

I am inclined to think that Mr. Rossi is right.  I dont see why everybody should leave the hill.  If Mr. Rossi is not to be in charge of the house and grounds Mr. Slattery should be and he should keep the people on their jobs except when they are given vacations moreover any permissions for vacations should be in writing and and copies should be sent me together with proper explanations about the reasons for vacations.  There must be strict discipline on the hill and matters are not to be left to the housekeeper or the butler or the policeman or watchman or the telegrapher.  These people are all subordinates subject to the orders of their manager whether it be Mr. Rossi or Mr. Slattery.

In case anyone leaves the hill without a written permission his salary is to be suspended during his absence and if he does this often he is to be dismissed

We must have organization and order

Sincerely

s/ WR Hearst

If what Rossi says about Bohn is reasonably accurate kindly dismiss him at once

s/ WRH.
