FIND ORDER HAZARD CANCELED WAS FOR SHRUBS AND PLANTS YOU SELECTED FROM CATALOGUE TO BE ORDERED AS NEEDED NOT FOR FRUIT TREES.   NOTHING ON ORDER YET DELIVERED.  NURSERY WANTS TO KNOW IF YOU WISH CANCELLATION TO STAND.  APPARENTLY ORDER SHOULD WITHER NOT HAVE BEEN GIVEN, OR NOT HAVE BEEN CANCELED.  WAS ON TOP IN YESTERDAYS STORM.  HITS A AND C EVERY TIME EXACTLY THE SAME PLACES CAMBRIA SIDE.
