Dear Miss Morgan:

I am sending you some photographs that Brummer has sent out. I do not think there is 
anything of much use to us.

It occurred to me that you might be able to use the two shorter columns on the south 
windows of the Assembly Hall at San Simeon, the one that you are now installing.  Mr. 
Joy tells me we have not genuine columns for this window.

This is the more important window of the two, - more important than the other window 
and we should have genuine columns for it.

The large doorway, which I mentioned in my letter to Mr. Brummer, might be useful at 
Wyntoon.  If you think so I can get it and probably get it for a smaller sum than is 
asked.

After you have looked over these things, will you mail them and my letter to Mr. 
Brummer, whose address is shown on his stationery.

Sincerely yours,

W.R. Hearst
