Dear Mr.Hearst;

I have just received a letter from Mr.Konta in regard to the Japanese collection and 
the Card Inventory.  I notice he calls Mr.Kajiwara " a very particular friend".  
I don't now how I made this impression.  I regretted that the list on this collection 
was not completed at the time we were on it, but we had to stop everything on 
Mr.Round's arrival to give him the aid he needed.

I telegraphed Mr.Konta today in regard to the completion of the Card Inventory that 
he had forgotten to cover the room and typewriter rental.  My reason for clinging 
to this record is that without something alphabetical and numerical to refer to, we 
have found trying to locate your things from the shipping-lists or receipt-lists 
almost impossible.  It took hours at times to find one entry even with eh help of 
my memory as to the approximate time of the article's arrival here, and the same 
difficulty will be encountered with the present inventory, which is correct as 
the usual inventory method, but difficulty in applying to your conditions.

Very truly yours,
JM:F
