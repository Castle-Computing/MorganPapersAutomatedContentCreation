Dear Mr. Hearst:

When George Loorz was engaged for this year, part of the agreement was a two weeks' 
vacation with pay.

He writes that he wants to take it over the holidays in order to take his family to 
Nevada to see his mother who is ill.  Thanking this would work in with Hill plans well, 
I told him yes, but would write and make sure the arrangement was agreeable to you.

Yours very truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
