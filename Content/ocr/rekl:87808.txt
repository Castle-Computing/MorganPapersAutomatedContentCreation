Dear Miss Morgan:

Please telegraph me to New York the size of the Ojival arches entering the new study 
on either side of the fireplace and going from the main study room into the smaller 
room and leading from the main study room into the two little rooms,-- six stone 
frames in all.

I am going to try to find genuine whole stone frames to fit in those places and to 
match with the genuine windows at the east end of the floor.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
