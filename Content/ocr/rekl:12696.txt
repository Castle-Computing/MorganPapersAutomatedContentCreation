THINK NEW PAYMENT ARRANGEMENT WILL MAKE FOR BETTER PRICE AND DELIVERIES.  THANK YOU VERY MUCH.  WILL PROMISE TO KEEP WITHIN LIMIT.  UPPER STORY CAN EASILY BE EXTENDED TO REAR WALL OF BREAKFAST ROOM AND BE (?) TO (?) OF REST OF FLOOR BUT AT EXPENSE OF HEIGHT OF ROYAL SMITH CEILINGS.  THESE WOULD BE TEN FT SIX INCHES CLEAR OF BEAMS.  PHOTOGRAPHS OF NEAR SHIP TO ARRIVE SINCE JOY LEFT.  WHAT A LOT FINE THINGS

JM.
