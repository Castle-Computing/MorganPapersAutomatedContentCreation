Dear Mr. Hearst:

The plants were arriving up the mountain Friday. They looked large  and vast in numbers down on the wharf, but dwindled as usual in  size as they reached the top. The plants from Santa Barbara and  first shipment from here, as I have written before, made no showing  at all. This one I think will. In any case, no trouble was spared  to get the best all combined nurseries could provide. Many of the  plants are individually for court of C, with a big old rose  opposite, that we found box grown in an out of way corner. The blue  flowering trees from Santa Barbara are about a foot high! It  seems they are too tender to move if of any size. 

Mr. Humrich is working on the walls and decorations of House B.   The lobby canvases were newly stretched and the doors all have  arrived on this steamer.  

In House A both bed room ceilings are under way and are gay and  pretty. There is enough of the rose damask for both bed rooms. It  would look better if the bottom instead of being a straight line,  were cut with the braiding. This could be done for the one to be  made from the wall vetement.  

The valance at the Hacienda is fine and might be turned in at the  top and used not shoeing a complete design, but otherwise it would  be too deep. 

If the damask is used for both rooms shall I have it made up? It will  take time to do.  

A really intelligent antique repairer was found, who has been at  work for weeks on repairing the choir stalls.  He has finished  getting the beds in order. The bed with the eagles on the posts has  a very heavy, poor new varnish over the old finish, - quite spoiling  it.  Mr. Humrich agrees with me that it should be cleaned off down  to the old wood. Would you agree? 

 Shall I have the broken chairs repaired red and the new bed in the  last shipments fitted up on arrival?  

Yours very truly,
