Dear Mr. Hearst:

There is no exhibition from you mother's collection on exhibit at the Spreckels Memorial Building at present.  There was a loan collection there from the University of California last year of tapestries and textiles - mainly your mother's gifts - but it was very temporary and was taken back months ago.

I went out to make sure, and there was nothing of any kind there in her name or yours.

Yours very truly,
