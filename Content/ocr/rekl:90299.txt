Dear Miss Morgan:

	I have got to stop work entirely at 
San Simeon. We can go ahead moderately on the 
San Simeon bunkhouse. Everything else had go 
to be stopped. 

	We will go through getting Wyntoon in 
shape, and then I may have to shut that down.

	Sincerely,
	
	WR Hearst
	
Miss Julia Morgan, 
San Francisco.
