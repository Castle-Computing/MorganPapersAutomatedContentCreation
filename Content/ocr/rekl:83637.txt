CONFIRMING TELEPHONE MESSAGE --

May 19, 1930.

Dear Mr. Joy:

I do not think we should wait any longer to have the marble steps put in the pool 
at the ranch.

There is no necessity for having a new design.

The marble steps at Miss Davies' pool are entirely satisfactory.  I would like to have 
four of these put in our pool up here, and all you have to do it to order duplicates 
made by the same people who made the steps at Miss Davies' pool.

I think furthermore that we might put a smooth concrete surface around the pool, and
 possibly decorate it with some marble insets.

This would give a little more finish to the place, and would not take much time or 
trouble.

I do not want to try to complete the pool entirely until the Venue fountain arrives 
from France.  I do not think that will be until next Spring.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Mr. Thaddeus Joy,
