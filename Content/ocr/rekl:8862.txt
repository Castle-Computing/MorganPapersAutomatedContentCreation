Dear Miss Morgan,
The cost of the bath room furnishings for A is $2541.50. This is an extravagant price and if I had known it I would never have authorized it.
You Submitted estimates on cost of floors walls and everything else. I think I should have had an estimate on this stuff - half of which I want use and the other halfI could have very well have gotten along with out.
Hereafter will you kindly submit estimates on any proposal that runs into money.
In most cases the cost can be modified and in some cases eliminated entirely
Sincerely
WR Hearst
P.S. There is further the matter of the design. It is not what Mrs Hearst had in mind. This too could have been corrected if the design had been submitted along with the estimates
In fact it seems to me that the way to do these domestic things personal furnishing walls ceilings carpets etcetera that we have to live with is to submit the designs and the estimates
Will you kindly proceed in these matters as we did in regard to the ceiling and [oblige?] 
Yours very sincerely
WRH
