Dear Miss Morgan:

I have the sketch of the study.  I think the idea in the main is very fine and of course an enormous improvement over anything that we could have possible done with the low ceiling.

I think we want to be careful not to have the Gothic beams or trusses too heavy. In the sketch they seem to overload or at least over-balance the lower part of the room with the panelling.

I really do not know whether it is better to have stone or to have wood.  A good deal depends upon the comparative cost.

There are some beautiful hammer-beam ceilings and Gothic ceilings of various kinds in English architecture, and there are several books in which these ceilings are reproduced in detail.

I doubt if I can get any such genuine ceilings but I will make an attempt.  Failing to get a genuine ceiling, we can reproduce a most suitable one in wood.

Or if the cost is too great, we could get a model or the motif at least, for a cast-stone ceiling, out of English architecture.

It is your idea, I suppose, to carry out the suggestion of the English panelling and have the whole room of English type.  I am very glad you had the thought of the higher roof.  It makes possible a very fine suite on this upper floor.

And I agree with you, even from the photograph of the model that I have seen, that the effect from the outside is excellent.  The building has added interest and dignity.

2.  I am exceedingly glad that the grading of what you call the 'Grande Place' is to be done by my return.

That will give us the right impression of the gymnasium construction.  I hope we can have the pools ready by New Year's as these inside pools will be the only ones we can use during the winter.

2-

It is not necessary to do anything else with the interior of the gymnasium.

3.  You will have received the signed contracts for the elevator before you receive this letter. The size of the elevator will do.  I suppose a larger one is not very feasible, if we are to have any stairways remain.

4.  Regarding the shelters - either one of the two shelters I have marked 'A' and 'B' will do - probably the one marked 'A', the top one, would be better because it is a little less obtrusive.

No. 2 is all right, and it is probably necessarily small on account of the limited space of the location.

No. 4 I do not like very much, and if we use one of the alternates for No. 1 we might use this alternate in place of No. 4

No. 5 is fine, also No. 6 and No. 7 - the one you forgot and sent in a later envelope - seems quite attractive.

In all these it is important to have the shelter genuine and sufficient, and I think the shelter should be against the wind as well as the rain.

There seems to be a good deal of openwork in these designs, and it occurs to me that it might be desirable to have better windbreaks.

Sincerely,
