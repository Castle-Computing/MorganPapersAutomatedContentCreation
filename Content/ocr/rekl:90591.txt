June 10, 1939.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I realize fully that everything has been most delightful and most liberal, and I of 
course would, if it were possible, prefer to have it continue on the same basis.

But circumstances demand the most limited possible expenditure on my part.

In fact, for the rest of the year I must not contemplate anything of any consequence.

Sincerely yours,
s/WR Hearst
