Dear Miss Morgan:

I am sorry that the chimney and window men were not successful.  Some how or other we have got to make the chimneys draw.  I suggest that they be rebuilt, all of them which do not draw satisfactorily, as soon as the rainy season is over.

2.  I hope we will get a genuine old ceiling from Byne, but if we do not the next best thing would be to have the Hotel Biltmore people do the ceiling, as you suggest.

Stop Humrich in any case.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
