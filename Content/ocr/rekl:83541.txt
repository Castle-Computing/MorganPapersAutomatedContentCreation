Dear Mr. Hearst,-

Yesterday was so exciting I did not take up some questions needing answers.

1.  As regards greenhouses.  Do you wish to provide more greenhouses at this time?  
Mr. Webb says he badly needs one more at least.  Lord & Burnham write in effect that 
while they started two units of greenhouses for you on Mr. Chatfield's orders, they 
do not consider the order a binding one.

On reading the specifications for these passed on to me by Mr. Slattery last month, I 
realize the specifications cover eastern conditions, and would have to be revised before
 an order is given.  Also a heating plant is included, while the one we have at present 
 is sufficient for all the units.

2.  As regards pergola. There are plenty of pergola columns at San Simeon to carry the
pergola some distance and the balance are ready here for shipment.  We found it would
 save handling to sh only such quantities as could be immediately used.  Shall Mr. Rossi 
 go onto this work now.  The rains, if following precedent, will be only intermittent
  form now on.

3.  As regards North Terrace and Recreation Wing.  Will it be all right if Mr. Rossi 
pours the North Terrace and then moves his crew onto the recreation wing?  The structural 
drawings are ready except for such adjustments as the new fenestration may make 
necessary.

Yours very truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
