Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst

Enclosed are some photographs of models.  The boar's head is not very good, but I will have it modified in the carving.

The ceiling panel is sent just to give you an idea of the scale of the work.  It should be a fine room

Sincerely yours,
JM-deM
