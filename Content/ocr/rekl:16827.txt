Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is a letter from Mr. Gutherz which may change plans in regard to him.

It seems very necessary to have a thoroughly competent warehouse man in charge of the new warehouses at San Simeon at least during the moving in period as an ordinarily good man who had no liking for, or understanding of, the problems peculiar to warehousing and caring for antiques, would make mix up difficulties that would carry well into the future.

I asked Mr. Minott's help in the matter and out of nearly two hundred applicants, have to suggest a Mr. Williams, who seems to meet conditions well if you think it right to pay the salary he wants - $250.00 per month and housing.  He built up a good general warehouse business in Canada and sold it to go into the warehousing for a large concern which recently was absorbed in a merger which suppressed the plant he was warehousing.   He came to San Francisco to help transfer the invoices, etcetera, and would like to locate with his family in California.  He is well enough educated to appreciate your fine things and want to protect them, is fully capable of installing a suitable record and placing system, and knows the importance of packing and unpacking valuable objects, etcetera, as such.  He looks about 45 years old.

The least salary for any one would be $200.00, but that would be for the type of man in charge of the Hill warehouse now, better for cement and nails than for objects of art.

As soon as the Patio drawings are out,

Mr. Olauson will go back to the Hill and stay as you asked.  He can help keep an eye on material as it is shipped in and handled on the Hill.

Yours very truly,
