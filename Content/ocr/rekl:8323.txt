Dear Miss Morgan:-

There are several details that require attention, and in some cases alteration.  

In the first place, we need screen doors on all the doors as we have discovered the fact that flies come in through the doors quite as well as through the windows.  I suggest that we slap-screen doors on springs so that they will close themselves and cannot be left open.  I do not see why we cannot make these doors in such a way that they will correspond with the windows and they can be taken off in the winter.  It makes a desirable combination.  I think we should have screen windows for all bath rooms.  In other words, something to exclude the flies, mosquitos, etc.

I find there are no moldings in any room to hang pictures, mirrors, etc.  Such moldings are absolutely necessary so that we can hang anything without driving nails in the walls.  This, of course, is wholly impracticable, because when we get an expert decorator to fill up the hole and match the wall tone. As the present arrangement of decorations is largely tentative and temporary, we will have a number of holes in the walls to be so treated.  But when they are finished, I don't want any further trouble of this kind so would to have moldings of sufficient strength to bear any ordinary weight of picture placed in every room and attended to while Mr. Humrich's men are still here.  It is the only way to meet this situation and I wish you would kindly give instructions to have it attended to immediately.

I do not know whether we understand each other in regard to the shades which are to be mounted on the windows.  Mrs. Hearst and I would like small compact shades mounted on top of the window frame just above the glass so that when the shades are up or down the windows could open perfectly freely.  These roller shades, would, of course, not be hidden, but they are the only kind which can be used in a way to make the windows entirely useful.  If this is not your idea and if there is anything wrong with this idea, will you kindly let me know.  It is true that there would not be what you might call room for such shades on the window frame or sash when the iron frames are installed, but there would be plenty of territory to place it even though it would enroach somewhat upon the top of the glass.  In other words, it could be mounted on the top of the frame, or across from the two side frames and located in the space that we think is best.  There is no other way that I can think of that would be universal as the decorative frames are on the windows as a whole in some or all of the houses and unless we fasten the roller shades on the windows themselves, we will have no definite system for each house. And the only thing left to do is secure a color such as blue that Mr. Humrich has used on the outside of the sash, or a green or something of that kind.

I think the floor space or side space in the basements should be concreted so that there will be no possibility of the wood rats, or moles or other animals of that kind cannot get in and eat up the wood and materials.  
Furthermore, all the small windows looking into these basements should be screened or covered with a heavy wire screen of sufficiently small mesh to prevent small animals like mice from getting in there.

I would like heavy cedar closets with drawers and outside doors built in the back parts of all of these basements in which to store the linen, blankets, clothes, rugs, tapestries, and such kind of things.  Some of the closets should be made for constant use while we are here and some others for the storage of clothes while we are away.  These closets should be built in all three homes, and should go clearly across form one side to the other, equipped entirely as I see the real losing of the created space.  This will all make some very large closets and we will still have some space for storing heavy articles like furniture, etc.

Very truly,
s/ W.R. Hearst
