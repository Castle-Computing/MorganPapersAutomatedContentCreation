March 30, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is Mr. Byne's letter in response to the cable you asked me to send.  Also the two photographs referred to and the inventory of the Almenas collection.

I wonder if there would be anything in seeing Mr. Laurvik of the San Francisco Museum.  If the trustees were really considering the purchase, it might be they would be glad to reduce the purchase by such articles as you might wish to buy.  Mr. Byne is mistaken in thinking I had brought the collection to Mr. Laurvik's attention.

Yours very truly,

[handwritten at bottom of this letter]
