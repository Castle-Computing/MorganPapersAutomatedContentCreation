Dear Mr. Hearst:

I was at San Simeon on Wednesday and Thursday and made a program with Mr. Rossi for carrying through the work on the main building as rapidly as we can.

Mr. Rossi has sent for some carpenters.  He had the library ceiling nearly finished with the exception of the frieze, which was about 25% complete.  Mr. Gyorgy was following up closely with his work.  Mr. Lorenz has all the caps, bases, pilasters and brackets out for the upper parts of the bookcases and they were sent to San Simeon today.  Mr. Suppo has about two week's work left to do on the lower case work.  This case work is all being sent "knocked down" for Mr. Rossi's men to set up at the job.  Of course the floor has not been laid because it will be the last thing done. We estimate that it will take until November 30th to finish the room.  This is estimating pretty closely.

The assembly room is not so easy and we planned to make it presentable rather than finished.  It will take some study to solve the problem involved in alterating the stalls and in the meantime we are setting up in the four corners of the room, the twenty three stalls of the set which are lower so as to dress the room a bit.  This lower set of choir stalls will go under the tapistries with a very slight alteration, but since your comming is no near at hand since we cannot have all the wainscote made before you arrive, it seems best to let the more radical alterations of the higher stalls go until you see them in the room and we have a chance to talk it over.

Mr. Rossi has moved the second oak and a great excavated area is left about the depth of the basement of the Recreation Wing.  It would be a saving of time and labor to put in the foundation of this wing before the filling is done around the tree and, with the foundation in, the concrete paving of the Patio could be finished.

This work would take no men from the finishing work inside and, in accordance with your instructions, we will do it now.

The present appearance of the pool could be much improved by setting the marble of the gutters and border without going into paving or anything that would be interfered with by the carrying out of the new garden scheme.

The garden scheme will be carried out as rapidly as possible, but I shall show you drawings first.

The tower tops are progressing.  Mr. Van der Loo is just commencing the modeling for the cast stone and it will be ready as Mr. Rossi needs it.

The tile for the crowning domes is ordered.

The pantry cases referred to in my telegram, which we are installing, are those that rest on the floor, the counters, sinks, etc. that have been made and waiting for a chance to put them in.  We will do it in such a way that service will not be interfered with during the installation.  As soon as they are set, the tile backs and trim can be put up.  The tile is on the place.

Miss Morgan is better and will, we trust, soon be out of danger.

Yours very truly,

s/ T.J.
