I got R on the phone last night & told him to have all men off job by Monday night latest - & to pass the word to [Keys?] & McC - Also called up McC in country but he had left in P.M. for S.S. Worst is, I told Pellegrini to go down, & he may have left Sunday. Please try & get hime & cut him off. Am dreadfully sorry for his disappointment. He did look so happy
I will go to L.A. Monday night & come back up here by Wed - just the same
