Mr.  William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

.1. 	As to the English House [see letter April 14.] -- I agree with you that it would be more difficult to do well between the big house and Moorish building than by itself on the far side of the main house garden court where one can think of it as fitting beautifully between and among the oaks.  There is some fine Tudor material in the library and I will take a tentative plan up this trip and try it out in the oaks before sending it to you.

2.	As to the large fountains--am starting them.

3.-	The finished-out design for the "Below B" motif has been delated until I could look it over in real life again.

4.	The trouble with the asphalt-cork filling the oaks was that on hot days it expanded, forced out the "corking" and spilled over the paths and plants.  I will hunt for something that does not expand.

5. 	Frigidier does not require so much electricity that we could  not use it in for something that will not expand.

6. 	I like the jars, but think for extensive use on the hill the plain body colors carry better than the broken surfaces.

7.	Will investigate into the latest improvements in intercommunicating telephones.  
We generally use the Devoe or Westinghouse outfit.  The secret of success in any of these seems to be in keeping water or dampness out of the under-ground conduit.

8. 	It would seem to me that the big houses should have a real furnace, also the English house.  It will be a wonderful place for a Christmas Holiday--but might be coincident with a cold snap.  It is 30 degrees on the top to-day.

Yours very truly,
