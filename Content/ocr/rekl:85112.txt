New York American

Feb. 27, 1932.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Enclosed please find photographs of some of the smaller mantels we have here in 
New York.  Among them you will find photographs of three of the mantels which you 
instructed should be s hipped in your letter of Feb. 8th.

The Gothic mantel No.3 purchased from French & Company I remember very well and, if
 I am not mistake, it was shipped WEst in 1923 or 1924.  However, I am checking this
  up and will advise you definitely.

A carload containing the mantels and other items that we have will go forward next week.

Sincerely,

s/ C A  McGregor
