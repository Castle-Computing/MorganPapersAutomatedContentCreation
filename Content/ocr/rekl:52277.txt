Dear Miss Morgan:

I am leaving for the East tomorrow Wednesday night.  I have a few last words, as it were, to say about the Hill.

I think we must positively proceed immediately to build certain animal houses and shelters.  I thought at one time that it was desirable to hide the houses in places where they would not be particularly conspicuous, but I find that the animals collect around such feeding places and shelter places, and that if we put the shelters in distant spots we would have our animals where we would never see them.

I would suggest, therefore, that we make these shelters exceedingly picturesque log houses and put them in certain picturesque locations not far from the main road.

Watering troughs can be put adjacent and feeding rooms established in connection, so that the animals will congregate at places where they can be seen from the road.  There are a number of trees clumps along the road where such shelters could be picturesquely located.

Will you kindly have these locations picked out at your earliest convenience.

I think the giraffes should be transferred from where they are. Nobody yet who has come to the ranch has seen the giraffes.

If you want to consult me about the locations, I suggest that you make the locations and then send me a road map with the locations marked on it, and perhaps some photographs and sketches of what it is proposed to do.

I do not think I shall buy any more animals this winter, so we need only make immediate provision for the animals that we already have.

2.  I think the Elk should be turned into the Buffalo field, and that all the large animals should go into that field.  If necessary we can enlarge the field by adding to it what is at

present the Elks field, but I do not think we should do this until the herd is increased.

It seems to me that headquarters or shelters of some kind should be located at the various gates.  There are three gates, the lowest one where you come into the Buffalo field, the second one where you go from the Buffalo field into the small animal field, and the third one where you go from the small animal field into the orchard enclosure.

The main headquarters should be at one or the other of these upper gates.

The best place to put it for some reason is the gate between the big animal field and the little animal field, but there is not much space at that location, and possibly it may be better, therefore, to put the main headquarters at the area just south of the upper gate, with a subordinate headquarters or lodge at the lowest gate and the picturesque shelter, feeding barns, etcetera at the intermediate gate.

There may be reasons for modifying this arrangement which you will discover.  I mean, I am not rigidly advocating this arrangement, merely suggesting it.

3.  Please talk to Slattery about Addison.  I am not sure that we are going to be able to keep Addison.  He is a very peculiar character, difficult to get along with.

Mr. Rossi has rounded up a man named Murphy, who might easily be a better man.

I understand Mr. Rossi's animus against Addison and am not accepting Rossi's views at par, but my own experience with Addison is that he is temperamental and difficult to get along with and that he is inclined to be extravagant.

His plan of a headquarters was ridiculous.  It meant an expenditure almost equal to that for the resident quarters.  His purchase of expensive saddles, and his desire to put everybody in uniform means a scale of expenditure which should not be encouraged.

All I want to say at the present time is that if Slattery finds it difficult to get along with Addison, as Rossi did, we had better promptly replace Addison by Murphy, who is, I understand, from other sources, a very good man.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
