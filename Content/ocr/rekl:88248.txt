Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your "Carillonneur" so far is Mr. Charles B. Weikel, who plays the campanile Chimes 
at the University of California.

He came up in 1932 to see what could be done to improve the installation, and advised 
the extra bells, a location for the carillonneur where he could hear them, and agreed 
to come back and arrange the bells in the openings in proper relation to each other 
as soon as the new keyboard and extra bells arrived.  He did say, however, that best 
results musically could not be obtained with a carillon located in two towers.

We paid his round trip traveling expenses from Berkeley to the ranch at the time.

Very truly yours,
