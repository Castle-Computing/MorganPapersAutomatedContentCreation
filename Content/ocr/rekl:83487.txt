Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your letter regarding work program was received after I left San Francisco for the 
ranch.

I agree with you that it would be just as well to continue on the present basis-Another
 month or two paying up back accounts and catching pu on the many small jobs.

I have written Mr. Rossi to this effect tonight.

Yours very truly,
