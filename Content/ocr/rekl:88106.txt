Confirmation of air mail letter
Nov. 7, 1935.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I think we should have the same fire protection on the Hill at the ranch that we have 
in the town of San Simeon for the warehouses,-- that is to say, an engine with water 
and a chemical engine.

I told Mr. Loorz what to get for the town.  I think we should duplicate the equipment 
on the Hill.

We will thus be protected in both places and moreover we will have equipment which can 
be moved along the road in case there are any more grass fires.

2. This is not immediate, but I think the salt water system should be laid out with 
some regard to fire.  In other words, there should be hydrants along the pipe lines.

I do not know where the pipe lines will go, whether they will go directly up reservoir 
hill or whether they will go up by the Hacienda hill.

Whichever way the water pipes go, I think fresh water pipes should go in he other 
place, so that we would have water supply available along two lines.

The pipes should be large enough to give ample water at the hydrants.

3.  I think the road should be built to be fire breaks as well as roads.  Therefore, 
they should be wide enough, and should be free of grass or any extra combustible 
material.

I suppose there is no danger of fire from now on during the winter, but we ought 
to be getting ready to meet possibilities next summer.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

NOTE:  Next summer we may have to have movable fire equipment at Wyntoon.  I do not 
know about that.  Probably the water supply is so entirely sufficient, that we will 
not have to have equipment.
