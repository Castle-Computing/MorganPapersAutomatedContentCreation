Dear Miss Morgan:

I think to complete the library furniture we
should have six low, over-stuffed chairs covered in some antique-
looking material that will harmonize in a general way with the
other colorings of the room.

Perhaps some of the materials that we did not pick out for
the twelve chairs and sofa would be suitable for these big easy
chairs, particularly the one I asked you to retain a sample of.

2. As I told you, I think we should have in the assembly
room, two enormous divans the full width of the window, very deep
and very low, but with short backs so the window will not be en-
croached upon.

I think in the assembly room we should have some of these
very comfortable over-stuffed chairs also. Perhaps four would be
enough -- at any rate not more than six.

3. I would like to suggest that the hangings at the
east end of the dining room or lobby be taken away from close
contact with the arch and put in the square opening as near as
possible to the gilt grill. I think this would make the arch
more notable, and I think it would also help the grill.

4. I would like to see the four great candelabra which
are now in the dining room suitably mounted with electric lights
and used in the east lobby. As I wrote you, [illegible] mountings for the
candelabra are very crude. They should be as artistic and effective
as possible, as nearly like what Caldwell does as we can get on the
Coast.

I have a man in Los Angeles who does very good work of this
kind, and I could get him if you want me to, but I have no doubt
you have your own people who can do this work perfectly well, and
if you have I will be glad to have your employ them.

There are quire a number of candelabra coming from the East,
a set of big ones for the library in the latest shipment and a set
of silver ones which I have just telegraphed McGregor to ship.

Sincerely,
