Dear Mr. Hearst:

	Stained glass in the end Study tracery would 
undoubtedly be the best and most interesting
solution. - There are two panels of glass about the 
right width standing against the side windows in the 
Celestial Suite Sitting Room. These set against the 
tracery would serve to truy out the effect. 

	I am enclosing photographs of the stained
glass you have now out here which apparently approaches
the width of the study openings. 

	Glass from the high lights of the octagons is 
the stock here, but that for the main clerestory 
openings will have to come from the eastern factory. 

	I will order it, but hold any orders for 
glass or curtains for the end windows. 

	As always,
