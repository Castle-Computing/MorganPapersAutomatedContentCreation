Mr. William R. Hearst
San Simeon, Calif.

Dear Mr. Hearst:-

The other evening Miss Morgan said she had a terrible shock for me, and that, had 
she known she had to be the bearer of the news, she would rather not have come to 
San Simeon.  The shock was unexpected, as it came like a thunder bolt out of a clear 
sky and left me speechless.  I have spent three most wretched days trying to fathom 
what might have caused you to so abruptly give such an order, and I have failed.  
My conscience is clear however.  I have been one hundred percent for you, I have 
always done my duty and have been as true and honest as the day is long.  In fact 
I CAN NOT BELIEVE THAT YOU WOULD WANT ME PERMANENTLY DISMISSED.

Could I have been accused of some wrong doing of which I know nothing?

Miss Morgan intimated that your decision was partly due to lack of funds.  If such 
be the case Mr. Hearst, you know I shall be glad to take any salary cut you see fit: 
I have been working for you faithfully and wholeheartedly for the last ten years, 
never counting the hours and putting in Sundays with pleasure whenever the job or 
Miss Morgan's presence demanded which as you know was often, and I would like to 
continue.  Anyway, money is not everything.  This is the work I like and enjoy.  
It is my ambition to finish the constructions I have started on the hill, and finish 
the road to Davis and it would be the greatest disappointment in my life if you did 
not let me do it.  I have refused several good offers in order to stay on with 
you.....and now!! is this my recompense?

Furthermore, to be let out at this time, the most critical time in my life, crushes 
me.  The little money I saved I invested in stocks.  You know what the market did.  
I lost...In order to recuperate I borrowed on the stocks and lost more, and now, 
not only I have not a cent to dispose of, but owe the bank a considerable sum.  
Then, I am trying to put my son through college, which I will not be able to do if 
I lose my only source of income (and I know, you that have been so philanthropical 
will not allow it) and again, to show you the utter precariousness of my situation, 
my Mother passed on a few weeks ago, and I have not as yet been able to meet the funeral 
expenses.  Now do you pity me?  I know that after ten years in your service you will 
not abandon me now when the depression makes work so hard to get.

My dear Miss Morgan: Mr Rossi seems to be in such desperate straits that I am repenting l
etting him go.  What do you say.  Shall we try him for another year.  Why not say to 
him frankly and finally, "Mr. Rossi whether you are right or wrong you make too much 
trouble.  We will give you one more chance to mind your own business and to get along 
with people.  If you cannot do this it is not they who will have to go.  It is you" 
I think he has had enough of a scare to be good for a year

Sincerely,

WRH
W.R.H. #2-

You know what deep respect I have for you, and that I want to carry on working for 
you.  I have lived in San Simeon for ten years, it is my home now and I don't want to 
leave it.  My little girl goes to school in Cambria and she too would be upset in her 
studies if we make an abrupt change?  Therefore I BESEECH you, confident that neither 
my work nor comportment could have prompted you to make such a decision, confident 
also that Miss Morgan would like to see me stay on, I beseech you to reconsider your 
order and let me remain in your employ.

We all have to fight in order to achieve our ends.  You fight for you principles in 
your wonderful editorials, and if at times I have had to squabble with any one, it 
has been to get efficiency and save you money.....and some times I wonder Does it 
pay to make enemies, just to save your employer's money?

Most sincerely yours,

s/ C.C. Rossi

P.S.  I am complying with your orders.....We are working on the road and drainage....The 
pergola has to be taken care of as some of the columns are being undermined.
