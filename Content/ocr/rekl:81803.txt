December 5, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The animal shelter is being reconstructed on the new site while the location of the 
parts are fresh in the men's minds - and Mr. Rossi is to send the shovel onto the 
Giraffe Building site today.

Coming back and being confronted with first of the month statements, I am wondering 
whether you wish this new building started at this time.  If we keep up the full force 
to the 22nd, which seems necessary in order to get to a good stopping place, there will 
be four payrolls for December which will take all our funds on the revised budget, 
which contemplated a heavy reduction for this month.  

The Social room work is underway.  Hadley's men completing the Ariadne Terrace pavement, 
Van der Loo completing the south terrace balustrades at the outer line of the circular 
steps, (a refinement) the main balustrades being all up, Mr. Rossi ready to pour the 
tennis court side steps, waterproofing men up for service wing and Celestial Suite 
openings, etc. where the sash are being put in permanent form.

If you will set the time when convenient, Miss Worn will be there and I will be on hand 
also, gladly.

Yours very truly,




Went over the proposed  pergola (?) and (?) (?) etc to get more pleasing perspectives .  
Gillespie was to go in with the tams today.
