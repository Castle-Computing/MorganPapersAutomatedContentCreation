Dear Mr. Hearst:

As you probably have calculated in a general way, The Bend expense, power line 
extensions, emergency payrolls, etc. have so swamped and shattered our careful 
budgeting that we have to ask you for whatever financial assistance you can allow.

The San Simeon budget is tied up in agreed payments on accounts on warehouse, marble, 
and general San Simeon setups, so that we would gain little by stopping work entirely 
there.

Kindly let me know how you wish us  to handle the problem.

As always,

Yours truly,
