Dear Miss Morgan:
	I will
be down as soon
as possible. 
	Miss Davies wants 
to make a big bed 
room at each end 
of the top floor. 
	She liked the big 
rooms at Wyntoon 
and the cheerful

	I thought that we 
could easily throw
the room I occupyand the room Mr. 
Willicombe uses 
together
	But then I would 
like to raise the ceiling
at least two feet to 
make nice proportions
to the room.

Another thing I want 
to do is to get better
effect out of the 
news garden.
	I think there should
be a wall dividing
the low part fromthe high part - 
a pleasant flight
of steps going up 
and a statue or 
a fountain as well 
as flower beds.
	Perhaps you would 
want to look at the 
garden and see if 
the idea is feasible. 

	Sincerely
	Wr Hearst
