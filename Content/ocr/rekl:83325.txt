Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst is returning the two antique stone tracery windows from St. Albans Cathedral 
to London and said:

"Tell Miss Morgan I am sending in their place four windows as good as the two windows 
from St. Alans."

With best wishes for a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.

Sincerely,

s/ H.O. Hunter
