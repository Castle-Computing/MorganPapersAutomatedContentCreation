Dear Mr. Hearst:

I am delighted to hear that San Simeon produced those horse armors!  So also will be 
young Martin Charles who has the understanding to enthuse with.

The Living Room plan for the Gables is greatly improved - But some private place for 
you?

Will bring you the new Angel Cottage sketches with eight and with six bed rooms.

I left Wyntoon there Saturday evening, Brown Bear Cottage being brought up to date and 
progressing well - the 'Pinnacles' (a fine name) foundation in-, the grading at the old 
Castle site on its wind-up.

An early rain would do wonders up there -

I think with the walls of the Pinnacles up, one could judge much more surely as to the 
effect of different sizes of 'Angels'.  'Brown Bear' looks quite a house since the river 
side dormers have given bulk.

As always

Yours very truly
