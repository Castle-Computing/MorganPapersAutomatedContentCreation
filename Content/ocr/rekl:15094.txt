Dear Mr. Hearst:

In making out the list of your ÒantiquesÓ shipped since 1919 to the Hacienda warehouse to go next week to San Simeon, I note the marquetry set, (bureau, panels, bed, desk, etc.)  Do you want them sent to San Simeon or put with the other collection in Stringers Warehouse, San Francisco?

Yours very truly,
