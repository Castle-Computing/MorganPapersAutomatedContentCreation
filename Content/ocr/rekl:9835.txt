February 15, 1922.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
House E has --
Her picture mouldings
" bath fittings
" bath doors deafened
" mantels all revised and finished as per your specification
" basement cupboards and chests in.
There remains --
Her chimney caps
" grille doors.
The bars for the doors are made, very well done, but I held the rest of the work to ask your opinion and choice of the two enclosed designs -- one for the single, and one for the double door arrangement.
Very truly yours,
JM-deM
Enclo.
