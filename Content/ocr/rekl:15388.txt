Dear Mr. Hearst:

On the receipt today from French and Company of the red brocade for the Doges Suite Sitting room I realized I must have misunderstood your saying "French & Co. will send more material" for I took it to mean more blue material and ordered work full speed ahead on it, with the result that the hangings are almost ready to send up -- and are very pretty.

If you do not approve, we did almost no cutting, and French and Company could surely dispose of the hangings as such.  I am very sorry however for my mistake.

The rooms are very well advanced -- mantels up, walls of bed rooms changed to gray as putting plenty of pink in the doors and window trims warmed up the room sufficiently.  The rooms tie together as a suite very well.

There probably should be a chandelier in the sitting room -- not for light so much as because the ceiling shows one originally hung from its center.  I cannot think of a suitable one here, unless we use one of those you are sending for one of the bed rooms.

I took all the old and odd hair mattresses from the Hacienda warehouse and am having them remade uniformly with new covers for the cloister and Doges Suite beds, and will have enough material over to finish out the antique beds not yet fitted.

As regards the warehouse we will be out of it in a few days.

Yours very truly,
