Dear Miss Morgan:

I think the billiard and pool tables ought to be placed a little differently:

First, the center of each table ought to come under the hanging light; and we ought to 
have in the bottom of that light, underneath, a circle of half a dozen lights to 
brilliantly light the table below.

And these brilliant lights should be on a separate switch so that they could be turned 
on when we wanted to play and turned off when the game was over.

Another switch would control the remainder of the lights.

This charge means taking the sofa away from the fireplace, and moving the rug and 
tables farther south to get the tables under the lights as stated above.

Will you kindly have this arranged?

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco.
