Dear Miss Morgan :

I am sending you a book on ceilings.  I think some interesting ceilings are on pates 12, 16, and 41, but particularly on pages 4, 5, 6, and 7.

In fact, the ceilings on pages 4 and 7 are so quaint and interesting that I think we should steal them entire for some part of our building.

They would go well in the big refectory room.  In fact, I think they would be wonderful there.  They are near enough to the Spanish, because they have a bit of Moorish influence, too, apparently.  You may find something in this book that we can use in the small houses also.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
