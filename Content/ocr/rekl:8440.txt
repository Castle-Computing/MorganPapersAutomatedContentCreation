Dear Miss Morgan:-

I have just telegraphed Mr. Fairchild to take up with you the matter of reducing expenses here.  The work is being carried on at more or less forced speed with, I think, undue expense on that account. 

I am suggesting that as soon as water is connected with the hill top, we drop all hurry work with the water plant and let the reservoir and pipeline from the reservoir to the plant be constructed slowly and economically with a small force.

I think also the power plant should be postponed for the present as we seem to have all the electricity we need even with the present water plan, and will certainly have plenty with the new water plan and turbine, which I figure with the water saved and head increased will practically double the present lighting  capacity.

Two.		A good many men are working in the gardens.  I think the force could be materially reduced here, in fact it would be alright to have nothing more done with the gardens except gradually taking up the annuals and substituting draught resisting shrubs and plants which can be grown with little or no gardening and with little or no water.  We are trying to do too much in the gardening line and while it is alright to get an immediate effect, we should drop down to a slow and careful plan of procedure on a permanent basis.

Three.	I thinkafter the house "C" is finished, we could only keep a few decorators and let them proceed leisurely with house "A".

Four.		I do not want to interfere with the concrete construction of the various pools and terraces, so keep a sufficient force here for the work but don' t let us keep anymore than we need. I would like to keep as far as possible men in the neighborhood.

In fact, in the gardening I think young Sebastian could be taught to attend to the whole of it perfectly well.  He has already worked with his father, who is an excellent gardener, and if he had the general direction of Mr. Dailey, he could do as well as anybody looks at him.  I am perfectly willing that he should be quit, in fact I would rather prefer that he did.

I will be in San Francisco from August 1st to the 6th.  If you are coming down, will you come either the latter part of next week or the week following the 6th.

Very truly,
s/ W.R. Hearst
