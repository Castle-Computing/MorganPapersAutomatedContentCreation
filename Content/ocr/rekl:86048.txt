Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, California.

Attention: Mr. Joy

Dear Miss Morgan:

	The long delay customs appeal matter, growing out
of the tax to be levied upon the importation of the shipment
of the artistic lamps entered through the port of San Francisco for 
the Hearst ranch comes up on December twenty-eighth, next.
	I find I have no pictures or sketches of the lamps. I
recall that Mr. Joy or someone else in your office made some
sketches from which the original models were sculptured, if
that is the technical word. I would like a copy of such sketches,
or better still, if you have in your possession any actual photographs,
I would be obliged if you could make them available to me.
	I have arranged with Mr. Rollins of the DeYoung Museum 
to testify as an expert as to the artistic value of the garden
lamps, which testimony will augment that which I have produced
through depositions. I would like some photographs to be 
identified by Mr. Rollins as likenesses of the lamps he has
observed at San Simeon. 

Yours very truly,

JOHN FRANCIS NEYLAN
