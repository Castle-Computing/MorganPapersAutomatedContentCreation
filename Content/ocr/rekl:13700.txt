Dear Miss Morgan:

I want to set aside a portion of the ranch for a farm, as I have already suggested.  I do not know exactly where to locate it for the convenience of Lee but I would think we should go to the West as far as the creek on which the Castro ranch is situated and include all of that plain, or rather flat to the East.

I should think, in fact, we might go to the East as far as Reservoir Hill and from there down to the bay.

That would give us quite an area on which we could run the good cattle -- Herefords, Jerseys and Durhams.

There would be no limitation of space for farm buildings and it would b much better than the Hill in some respects.  There would be plenty of grazing land and very little hauling to do in order to take care of the cattle.  we could have cow barns and dairies and a hay barn and chickens,m etc.

I think we would better make some plans for a little community of that character.  I think it would be better to separate it from the ranch house and that is the reason I suggest moving it down that far West.  Otherwise there might be some conflict with Lee.

I would like Lee to have charge of the ranch and the beef cattle, but I think we must get a scientific farm manager to take care of these other things.  That is the only way to handle it, as Lee really does not know enough about the more scientific aspects of farm management; and moreover, even if he did he would not have time to attend to it.

Will you please discuss the situation with Richard Clark and prepare some preliminary sketches for these farm buildings.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
