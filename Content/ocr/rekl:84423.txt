June 7, 1928

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Clark has asked us to provide him, for Mr. Konta, with the cost of the development at San Simeon.

We have never given San Simeon cost information to anyone without your instructions.  Shall we furnish, as cost, the total expenditure through this office since 1919?  This would not show the cost of various antiques incorporated into the buildings which form so large a part of the value of the buildings.

Yours very truly,
