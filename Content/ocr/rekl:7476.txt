Dear Miss Morgan:

I find a lot of Moorish tiles at French's here in New York. They  are genuine but not so remarkable that they could not be used for  borders of pavements or for outside wall decorations or something  of that kind.  

I can get them for $6 a running foot, and I should say there were  at least 200 running feet of them. Where and how can we use them?  

There probably will be enough to put borders around all three of  the courts. They could be used possibly as borders around some of  the windows and the grills. In fact they could be made decorative  in lots of ways, and they are genuine old Moorish tiles.  

If you will send me a telegram or write me a letter saying about  how much of these you think you could use in advantageously, I will  get them and ship them.

Sincerely Yours,
s/ WR Hearst
