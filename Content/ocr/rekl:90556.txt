Mr.William Randolph Hearst
La Cuesta Encantada
San Simeon, California

Dear Mr.Hearst:

In regard to House "C" - if we "wreck" the Sitting Room and the present circular 
stairs and adjacent closets, without injuring the bed rooms or baths, we could set 
light steel columns inside the sitting room walls, carrying them down to footings 
below, and up to take roof of room above - perhaps using the fine Mooresque ceiling 
( tried out above theatre) over the Sitting Room, and the Byne tile one over the new 
second story room.

If too fine, the beam ceilings of which photographs are enclosed, would be easily 
adapted.

All ceilings are at San Simeon.

As Always
