Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst gave me a list of Persian manuscripts to be filed away.  He told me to say 
that he would like to have these Persian manuscripts and other valuable manuscripts 
etcetera that belong to his mother put in the book safes at the Hacienda in San Simeon.

Will you see that this is done or is there anything further that I can do in the matter?

Sincerely yours,

s/ J Willicombe
