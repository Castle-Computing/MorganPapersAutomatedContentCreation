Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This is a letter on floors.  The materials with prices per foot and the drawing referred to below have been mailed separately to you.

I. Social Room Floors:  The teak for this should be finely seasoned by this time.  The boards are 7" wide, giving about 6 1/4" finished width.  Would you prefer this floor to run plain (except for the usual return at the ends ) or would you prefer to have it laid herringbone or in large squares?

[Margin Notes]
I think large square or amount of the size of the rooms--like this-


II. The material far the Refectory floor is being made up and is of California Travertine in 18"xx36" blocks laid in a species of herringbone pattern, as agreed.

[Margin Notes]
OK

III.  Designs are sent for two schemes for THE HALL floor, the idea being to use the same yellow and black marble as in the living room of House A.

[Margin Notes]
Think we might have something a little different - perhaps red and black

IV.  would you wish to use the mosaic panel (photograph enclosed) for the entrance porch off THE HALL floor, the idea being to use the same yellow and black marble as in the living room of House A.

[Margin Notes]
I don't think so.  I like the stone mosaics for lower halls and design of A

V.  As to the Royal Suite floors -- would terrazzo floors, with black marble borders, the terrazzo made with the greenish blue rock found on the Ranch, seem feasible?  Or would you prefer marble floors -- black and white?  -- or would any of the marble samples sent be suitable?

[Margin Notes]
Don't know about the wearing quality of the greenish blue rock

Black and white is very (?) - I think something softer would be better - something quieter and easier to live with.
VI.  the library floor you said to make of teak -- shall this be laid plain or herringbone?

[Margin Notes]

Either way plain perhaps but herring bone would be all right for the smaller room.  I have an idea though that herring bone suggest a leer period.

VII.  In the small bed rooms, would terrazzo, different colors for different rooms with uniform black marble borders do?  This material could be made in blocks and laid like marble slabs.

[Margin Notes]
In the small cloisters stone would be good

IX.  The floors for the various decks of the main building offer field for thought as the glaring reflections of a too light colored floor would be bothersome in the rooms.  Some of these, (around the library) should be laid next month.  would the combination of grey green and dark green marble, or the two shade of yellowish mottled marble be satisfactory to you, laid following one of the designs enclosed with the marble?

[Margin Notes]
Yes, very good there must be quite and rest here and also suggest the softening effects of age.

Also
X.  As to the floors of the new rooms in houses C, A, &B -- do you wish these to be marble or terrazzo, or would small tile do?

[Margin Notes]
A small (?) tile would do but I think transition or something of that kind would be better.  Would marble be a little to refined for these lower rooms.

Sincerely yours,
