REPORT ON CONSTRUCTION WORK AT SAN SIMEON

GEORGE LOORZ.

SEPTEMBER 14, 1934.

BURNETT ROAD

1.	Bridge completed, wood frame with steel rods, 35 ton capacity, 14 ft. roadbed, 
net cost with concrete abutments $3,500.  Estimate to Mr. Hearst $5,000 Approximately.

2.	Road completed through to Milpitas Ranch.  Made new straight road for seven miles 
from point where we joined the old road.  (Note--This seven miles very dusty, almost 
prohibitive to traffic; will settle and bald after first rain.)

3.	All culverts installed except two large ones near other end  which are now fords 
and perhaps should be bridges.

4.	Both tractors with two operators and two extra men working back toward hilltop 
taking off sharpest curves, widening narrow spots and finishing blading.  Crew already 
back to Burnett.

5.	As per letters and personal instructions from Mr. Hearst will work back to  High 
Dam Site below first bridge and run in temporary construction road to be ready to 
construct when advised.

6.	As per letter from Mr. Hearst in December last will then run new and better road 
from hilltop to first bridge at bottom of canyon.  Had hoped to see Mr. Hearst to make 
certain that he approved location and that he wanted it done this fall.  With the above 
mentioned small crew this would not be nearly as costly per mile as the same type of 
construction done previously.

7.	There are 9 gates to open and close between hilltop and Milpitas.  Wonder if Mr.
Hearst would permit instead cheap construction cattle-guards.

-------------------

PIPE LINE BEARTRAP SPRING TO BURNETT

1.	This line and concrete intake have been completed two months ago.

2.	Mr. Keep has Sequoias ordered and I believe intends to plant the grove when the 
weather cools.

3.	Could construct the reservoir at the Bear-trap flat as per several conversations with
 Mr. Hearst if her preferred to use the road equipment for that instead of the new road down the hill.  ThereREPORT ON CONSTRUCTION WORK AT SAN SIMEON -- 2.

will be plenty of water for Mr. Keep without it until the ranch begins to use more of 
the water for cattle as they plan.  It might make an ideal fishing hole when stocked.  
(Note-- I find that it might be necessary to put a thin coat of concrete to waterproof 
the reservoir.  On surface it appears to be on a porous rock foundation.)

-------------------

MISCELLANEOUS ANIMAL STRUCTURES

1.	Temporary repairs made to Giraffe barn which will apparently house them quite 
comfortable until  permanent structure is built.

2.	Carey Baldwin just recently asked to have the South wall waterproofed before 
winter.  This is sample and will be done.

3.  	Buffalo dip was completed over two months past and has been used for both 
Buffalo and Elk.

4.	Gillespie and crew of two men have put up a good solid fence around Eucalyptus 
grove at first gate.

5.	Fence crew is now reenforcing temporary fence around Strawberry Hill.

6.	Some coyote proofing was placed under fence to keep varmint out.

-------------------


ORCHARD FENCE

1.	Gillespie and crew moved the fence near the road on the South side near the gate to 
an inconspicuous position further down hill as per Mr. Hearst's request some time ago.

-------------------

KENNELS

1.	Proper kennels combined in one house similar to those at Beach House built at zoo 
to comfortable house all dogs.  Design similar in utility but cheap in construction, 
and including heat and ventilation fan which were necessary at times. (Note-- This work 
was done on the Hilltop fund account and charged back to Piedmont Land and Cattle 
Company as instructed.)

CONSTRUCTION UNDER MISS MORGAN

1.	STUDY
	a..Mr. Solon has nearly all of ceiling and girders down to floor covered.  Has to 
	go over and enrich with color and strengthen figure outlines. Hopes to have very 
	presentable job by October 4th.REPORT ON CONSTRUCTION WORK AT SAN SIMEON -- 3.

	b..Bookcases nearly all built but carvers doing inlaid work in San Francisco have 
	several more panels and doors to do yet before we can complete then.  They are 
	very rich and they are making good time, but there are a lot them.

	c..The newly installed antique Mantel (large) is apparently quite successful.

	d..The small mantel is also completed.

2.	NEPTUNE POOL
	
	a..All marble work of pool proper of large pool completed.  Now setting the large 
	Statue Group and cleaning marble preparatory to filling with water.  New filters 
	are completed with all circulating pipe lines; also heating units are ready for 
	use and should be operating within two weeks.

	b..Small upper pool marble work nearly completed.  Ready to set statue, if here, 
	next week.  Maybe the large one that just arrived is to go there.  Miss Morgan 
	will know, and she is due tomorrow.

3.	COLONADES AT END OF POOL

	a..All marble columns, bases and caps have been set.

	b..Most of framework of one is ready to receive cast plaster forms for pouring 
	concrete.

	c..Plaster forms all modeled and approved and many of castings already completed.  
	Should have enough to start setting for concrete in about two weeks.

4.	TEMPLE

	a..Good deal of form work and portion of steel already installed.

	b..Crew started setting the antique columns and caps this date.  It will take a 
	little time to safely dowel and set these antiques.  They must be doweled properly 
	to insure safe installation for the heavy antique frieze and roof above.

5.	MISCELLANEOUS CONSTRUCTION ABOUT THE HOUSE

	a..Breakfast room mantel deepened and proper louvered vents installed.

	b..Proper screens now being installed in Celestial Living Room.

	c.. Practical door latches and screens installed on storms sash of Celestial 
	bedrooms.

	also rusting ironwork.  Houses in good shape for winter.REPORT ON CONSTRUCTION WORK AT SAN SIMEON -- 4.

	e..Tile panels placed in Billiard Room to replace pictures that Mr. Hearst did not 
	care for.

	f..A lot of progress made on the carved upper cornice.  As soon as I have men 
	available I have more material to place.

	g..The windows in the Study were raised as requested.

	h..100 cast beams for pergola ready; no other pergola work has been done this 
	season.
