Dear Mr. Hearst:

Before starting Mr. Van der Loo on the study ceiling, full size details for which are all ready, I am wondering if you will ever be satisfied with the limited height of the room.  It has bothered me at all hours - and has brought this suggestion: -

Suppose we take off the roof from stair tower to stair tower - not the cornice or the piece of roof over the cloister galleries - but that from wall to wall over the study proper. Then put back a roof whose small cornice would line with that of the lanterns of the little octagonal stair towers.  This would give a little clere story all along each side of the room for windows.  The new concrete slab for the roof would be supported by steel trusses resting chiefly on the present study walls.

This proposed new roof would not be seen from the west on account of the Celestial Suite bath room construction.  From the east, if seen at all, it would not spoil the general composition, -- and from the sides, now that the new wing gives weight and balance to the composition, the effect might be distinctly good.  From my (future) mosquito-like aeroplane it might look queer when directly over the Library lobby, but I notice you do not have time in passing to worry greatly over detail.

The steel trusses could be encased in cast work such as we have already detailed, or as you may suggest.  We could space the new trusses so as to give twice the present centering, -- that is make them twice as far apart as at present.

Work is progressing on the Gothic Lobby.  We cannot do much more on the rooms until the panelling arrives from Miss Head.

Yours very truly,
