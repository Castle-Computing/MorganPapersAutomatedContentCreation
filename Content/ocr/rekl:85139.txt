Dear Miss Morgan:

I think the large stone door is fine for the end of the billiard room; but I do not 
think the small stone doorway is as good as we can get.  In fact, I do not think it 
is as good as the doorway of the same kind which has the two escutcheons on it, which 
we recently purchased from Demotte.

Possibly we have still other doorways from which we might choose.

2.  As I remember the Romanesque mantel, it did not seem so very large.  But we will 
know better when we get definite details from Chris.

Of course, as you say, in character it is perfect.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
