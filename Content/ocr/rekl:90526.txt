Miss Julia Morgan, 
1135 Merchants Exchange Building, 
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Miss Morgan:-

	As per your suggestion, I have written to Mr. Hearst on my brother's 
matter, about which I wrote you. As I shall be sailing positively on
the 7th instant, and so as to avoid the risk of a letter from you getting 
lost, will you please from now on communicate direct with my brother
in Paris, if anything new should happen. 

	Although it is two weeks since I have written Mr. Hearst and have not 
received a reply, I prefer not to write to him again, and to let my brother do 
so after my return - unless you think it would be better for me to write
Mr. Hearst before I sail. If so, will you be kind enough to drop me a 
few words upon receipt of this letter. 

Again thanking you, beg to remain, 

Very sincerely yours, 
Henri Cassou
