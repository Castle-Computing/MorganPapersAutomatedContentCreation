Dear Mr. Hearst:

By good luck the first storm of the season and self arrived on the Hill together -- no damage was done, but the road work will certainly have to be pushed, as the soft new earth, unless rocked, is going to make the road in places dangerous for several days after a storm.

The steel reinforcement is ready for the 'C' terrace pour, as are the second story service wing walls, -also forming for the 'attic' of the tennis court entrance motif is well along.

The surprise of the day was the finding of the Gothic furniture in eleven unlabeled cases numbered 1 to 11 which apparently came from Los Angeles via San Pedro.  There were altogether from Los Angeles, seven sets of cases with numbers beginning with one and running in some sets to 15 cases, without photographs, shipping list, or indication of contents or of set, or any way of telling what cases belonged together except by opening.  On account of the crowded conditions in the warehouses the opening and sorting into sets, etc. has been slow, partly too, because it has been necessary to se personally the contents n order to 'recognize'.  (I stop each trip on the way up or down.)

Anyway - there are two beds, two armoires, one lovely stone figure with perforated stone stand, one small polychrome wood figure, one over door, one pair doors, and one single lovely door from a wainscot.  Mr. Williams is photographing now.  From the inner boxing we find these came from 'Jansen Inc.' and were shipped by the 'King's Storage and Packing Co.' They were beautifully

packed.  There are still seggregrated out from the 'known' material some 50 to 60 medium and small cases and barrels (mostly from the original 'direct from Hacienda' van shipments) yet to open, which will complete the checking of all your goods here at San Simeon or San Francisco, except that we have not attempted to disentangle ceilings, etc. where several are known to be mixed.

There are two items only on all the carload shipments I have not been able to locate, but will wait opening the remaining cases before bewailing as lost.

Yours very truly,
