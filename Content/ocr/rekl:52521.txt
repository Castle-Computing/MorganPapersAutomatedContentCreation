January 20, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you very much for today's telegram saying we may work on a forty thousand dollar monthly basis from Mr. Neylan, with help if necessary from you directly.

What worried me was the notice from Mr. Neylan's office that retroactively to January first, the allowance was to be $30,000.00 which gave no funds with which to meet due bills, -- this because the labor bills for the summer and fall months ran so high (around $30,000 per month) that we fell behind on payments for material.  One month we had over $10,000.00 worth of steel and used a carload of cement a week.

If we can have the money you propose for February and March, we will be paid up fairly to normal, and from then on can work on any amount you set.  I do not want, or mean, to be greedy.

As to the cost of the activities now transferred to Mr. Slattery -- expenses have been as follows for 1927 --

	Materials - 	Garden		$7251.48
			Orchard		    265.00
			Farm mach'y	    245.17
			Stock & (?)
				animals	  7471.84

	Labor -	Keep			  5998.47
			Macklen		10185.86
   Men provided by Rossi			  8702.32

					          $40120.14

For the year 1925 - average per month - 	$2501.00
For the year 1926 - average per month - 	$2682.00
For the year 1927 - average per month - 	$3820.00

We are still paying the board and camp

expenses for the Slattery pay rolls which are included in the above.  Perhaps the present higher expenses are apparent rather than actual, as while the pay rolls are always met as incurred, the material bills (nursery stock, food, etc.) were paid in installments spread over the twelve months, the only way we can handle bills on the budget plan. Mr. Clark may be paying bills in full as received.

Obviously it will take more to run the 'Slattery activities' than formerly, and any basis you set for us will be cheerfully adhered to - once we get February and March payments.

Yours very truly,

[Handwritten Note on above Letter]
