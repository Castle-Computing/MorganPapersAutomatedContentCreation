Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear MR. Hearst:

The enclosed letter is self-explanatory.

The weather is good and we are putting all of our efforts in getting the Main Building into proper shape.  I would much appreciate it if you would send back the blue-line drawings of the front and side elevations - the ones showing the use of your iron balconies outside the Imperial Suite windows, - with your comments.

Sincerely yours

JM
GRC
