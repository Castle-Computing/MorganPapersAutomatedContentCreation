Dear Miss Morgan:

I like the tile you had made very much.   I don't care for the smaller design.  There are some fine tile designs in the little book - Spanish Maiolica - 63 would be good for a floor.  In the wall tiles for our dado in C we have got to be careful not to get anything that suggests what are accepted as bathroom effects.  I think 74 or 75 and also 82 get away from that idea somewhat.  I would like to get a luster as on some of our old samples.  The escutcheons 84 and 85 are fine.  If we had one in the middle of each panel or one in each of the four corners of the panel they would give a lot of desired character.  I like 87 very much indeed for C.  I has the Arabic quality.  The later tiles are not so good, but 105 - 131 - 137 have good designs and the little animals in 110 are interesting.  The heraldic tiles 143 and 144 are interesting.  The heraldic 143 and 144 are interesting and the inlaid brick design is good.

In regard to the pergolas, - I like the complete pergola or double  row of columns best,  - with walk between.  This will compose better.  The single row of columns looks thin.  The double row will give oppotunities for splendid vine and flower effects.  We can also grow grapes and such things on â€˜em.  We can get plenty of earth especially next the inside columns to grow things in.

I like the columns and vases on your Toarmina postal card and a general effect something like the Amalfi pergola.

I dont know exactly what you wanted me to look at in the other books but I have found a latticed window in the Brochure 
series 208, entrance to the Mexuar which I would like to use in the bath rooms.

I like the detail in the friezes in the big book.  I particularly like the little Persian or Arabian gentlemen comfortably seated in Oriental occupation of doing nothing in particular.

I think we are fixed for the immediate future even if I do not see you again today.  I will try to do so, however, when I can get away from the lawyers.

Sincerely
W.R.Hearst
