Mr. William Randolph Hearst
La Cuesta Encantada
San Simeon, California 

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	I am sorry my voice was so 
husky last night.

	This is just to say that 
Wyntoon is at its best, the tiger lilies coming
out and the wild roses and all foliage 
beautifully clean and fresh from the late rains. 

	The houses too are cheerfully 
crisp and fresh. 

	I do hope you will have the 
pleasure of it while this fine weather holds. 

	As always, with appreciation
for all you have given me of interest and pleasure, 

Very truly yours, 

JM:F
