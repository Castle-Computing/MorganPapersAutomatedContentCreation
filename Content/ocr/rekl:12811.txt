Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

It has taken time to arrive at the conclusion you asked in regard to the water pipe problem.  As an experiment, Mr. Rossi changed the pipe from the reservoir to the Hill, using 5" galvanized pipe and the 3" for about 3000 feet, or until past the first down and up "V" of the line, cleaning and relaying the balance of the pipe.  It almost double the flow to the Hill.

To do the same for the whole Pine Mountain line would be very expensive.

Mr. Rossi has now been all up and down this line, making necessary repairs.  Mr. Lee has been called into consultation as you requested.  All the observations and conclusions tally -- viz -- that it was a mistake to have used the iron pipe.  That it would cost some $2000 or more to dig it up, or lift it, clean and relay it -- and that it would be in just as bad condition in another year or eighteen months, and to be done over again.  That it would be better to put the money into replacing it gradually with larger galvanized pipe, replacing first the heavy "V's" near the source.  That if we used all the water for the Hill the pipe would give in its present condition, we would have enough water if reasonable judgment is used in watering outside of the white wall -- but that it might not be if used for the power plants -- which of course could rely on the engine.

As another factor the local power company have advanced a new offer.  They have brought their lines to Cambria (now a brilliantly lighted metropolis ) and as I understand it, would run on their poles to San Simeon and up the hill 
on your poles, for the patronage -- as they now figure they can handle your load without the "booster" plant they thought necessary when making their original proposition.  Would you care for their offer in detail?

We are laying on top of the ground temporary pipe to water the Spring Hill and Citrus areas this summer and fall and perhaps next year the same seasons, as everyone says it will be necessary in order to give the trees a fair start.  After that the Spring Hill pipe can be moved to newer planting areas.  It is predicted that the citrus will need irrigation at intervals for some years.

I am following instructions as far as possible in the outside area planting of "drought resisters", but realize from the way that rain perked plants up, that even hardy things in new environments stand a better chance with some indulgence.

I wish you could have been on the Hill today, it was so lovely.  The planting looks finely -- the little orchard trees heading out, vines sprouting, and young foresting taking heart.  Some of the sequoias are burning brown from the salt fogs the winds have blown in and Mr. Keep is covering them with white cheese cloth to try to save them.  Last night at dusk the meadow looked like the gathering place of a gigantic Ku Klux Klan.

Sincerely yours,
JM-deM
