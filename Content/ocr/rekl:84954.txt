December 30th, 1931

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Los Angeles Examiner,
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The enclosed is just received. Apparently
Monsieur Michiel died.

The bells, of course, are still in the
Customs warehouse. As the camp is closed down and trucks,
carpenters, laborers and electricians, etc., will all be
needed for respective parts of the installation, it seems
a poor time for him to have come on.

Would you kindly, as the son is in Santa
Monica, let him know what you wish to have done.

As always,

Yours very truly,

JM-M
