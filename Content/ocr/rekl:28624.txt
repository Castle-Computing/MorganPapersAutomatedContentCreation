Dear Miss Morgan:

I think I would like to have the inter-communicating telephone system put in this Fall before the Winter months.  If we are here in the Winter we need something of that kind.

In Summer the telephone system is not so important-- we can run out and 'holler' or hunt for people; but in the Winter, especially if it is storming, it is very desirable to have a telephone system.

Suppose we plant to put it in about the first of October; and I think we can definitely decide that the telegraph and telephone house will be about where we originally intended to have the servants' house.  That is somewhere down in front of the kitchen.

Consequently, the telephone cables could be brought into the present house and carried on from there to this other locality-- a little to the East of it-- when the telephone house is removed.

2.  Everyone seems to think that there should be dressing rooms in the neighborhood of the pool.  I do not know exactly how to arrange them but I suppose they can be arranged some way.

They could not go into the lower wall on the West side because they would injure the effect, I am afraid.  They might go into the lower wall on the north side but even there they would not improve  the landscape.

It occurs to me that the best thing might be to erect some sort of a little garden house or 'Temple of Vesta' to the South of the Colonnade in that V-shaped space where we were going to plant trees to correspond with the oak trees on the other side of C.

The location is good.  It is sufficiently near the pool and something might be put there which would actually improve the landscape.  Will you try to think out something on that basis.

If we cannot do that I do not know of anything except to take the Roman Temple and omit the sanctuary and put doors back of each space between the columns and have bath houses there.

Sincerely,
