Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As telegraphed last night, Las Estrellas has had a through trying out climatically this winter and really has come through beautifully on the whole.  The palm trees have been well whipped as to leaves, but have all survived and only the pelagoneums and delicate ground things have suffered.  Some bougainvilleas are thriving wonderfully.

There was a cave in below the B well motif and the road will come so close to the bank I withdraw the suggestion sent you, substituting the enclosed.

The trucks are hauling dirt for the tree pockets in the orchard.  When that is done      they will bring the needed earth for the butterfly area so that can be laid out, as its effect will have to be judged on the spot.

The laborers  "Limited" as having some amusing effects, but I should judge increases the efficiency very much, as Washburn, Gillespie, Hazard all want to get as much out of them possible while they have a chance at them.  Of course they all ask for more help, but while you might be disappointed first glance, work is up to schedule.  The temporary fences are around the planting areas and as soon as the trees area in the men will be put on the main fence and then back onto the new kitchen and the garage.

Yours truly,
