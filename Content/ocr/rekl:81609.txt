Hotel de Crillon, Place de la Concorde

11th September 1928.

Dear Miss Morgan,

I have the plan of the indoor pools and court.  I think the plans are satisfactory. 
 I wanted to make sure that the smaller pool was actually a part of the big pool, and 
 that the bottom of the small pool towards the north was on a level with the bottom of
  the large pool where the two join on bridge.  The small pool could shelve up from 
  about three to four feet at its shallowest southern side.

I suggest too, that the hard ball court and the squash courts should not have any doors
 in their walls to interrupt that section of the wall surface, except the necessary exit
  course.

Will you please locate the bridge where you think it will be most attractive.  It may 
be best where it is and it may not.  It seems to me as I am studying the plan, it might
 be very effective at the southern side of the lounge section or in the middle of the 
 lounge section.  It would be better seen in either one of those places.  In the middle,
  it might have a better Venetian Bridge effect.

I do not know that I can suggest anything further, except that the little rooms by this 
be kept as far south as possible in the space that has been allotted them, so that there
 will be quite a considerable space for dressing.

I imagine this is the plan in mind, although it is not definitely indicated on the 
drawing.  All the layout seems entirely satisfactory.

I only hope it will be ready by the time we get back.  It will be too bad to be deprived
 of the tennis courts, since they are the most used of the amusement features of the 
 Ranch.  Perhaps by concentrating the work on them a little you can have them ready 
 by our return, which will be the middle of October.

Yours sincerely,
