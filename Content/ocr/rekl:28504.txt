July 22, 1927.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Have just read a copy of your 'memo' to Mr. Rossi.

1.	It is no great matter to make the connection from the bay of the Shooting Gallery next the stairway to the Tennis Court, but it does not 'enter' very naturally.  How would it do to put back the 'wings' or projections we once had at each side of the courts?  Small sketch enclosed.

2.	The storm doors and sash of the Gothic suite were made extra heavy after we discovered the difficulty with the even 'better than usual' ones of the small houses. They are heavy almost to clumsiness and have given no trouble.  If throughly weather stripped at once, will they do?

3.	Ample piping for steam or hot water heating is in place in the Gothic Suite (but not below).

4.  	We we will have the Study drawings for you.

5.	Mr. Joy just missed you at the Hill.  He took a good draftsman down from here.

Yours very truly,
