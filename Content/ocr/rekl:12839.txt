My dear Miss Morgan: -

Regarding the grille.

I think the more grille there is the handsomer the effect is.  At the same time, I do not like blind doors.  Therefore, I would say that I prefer as wide a grille as possible permitting the individual doors.

Regarding the temple and the pool.

I like best the Sketch "C", which I am returning to you.  The sweep of this design seems to me much the more attractive.  I also like the width of the pool and the rather big benches.  I do not particularly like the idea of reflecting myself in the pool, as I think other reflections would be more scenic ---but I do like the general plan of this sketch "C" and the idea of the four Hermes at the end of the benches.

I would select this sketch, therefore, and suggest that the plan be made along these lines.

In this connection, I advise that the temple be raised rather high.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
