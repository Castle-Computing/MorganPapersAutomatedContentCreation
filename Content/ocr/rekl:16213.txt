THE VERMONT MARBLE PEOPLE CAME TO SEE ME ABOUT SOME TILE I DO NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT THESE PEOPLE SAID THAT IF WE ORDERED THIS TILE FROM THEM NOW IT WOULD BE READY IN A MONTH I DO NOT KNOW WHETHER THEY CALL SLABS OF MARBLE TILE OR WHETHER THEY ARE REALLY REFERRING TO ACTUAL TILE I THINK ANY QUERY OF THIS KIND WOULD BETTER COME FROM YOU TO ME DIRECT WITH SUFFICIENT EXPLANATION TO ENABLE ME TO GIVE A DECISION

W R HEARST.
