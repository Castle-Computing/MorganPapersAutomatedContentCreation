Dear Miss Morgan:-
Richard Clark suggests locating Jerseys also chickens, etcetera, on flats near ocean because feed, water and pasture area available there. 
I think we could have Herefords there too and have farm superintendent to run live stock, vegetable gardens, corn fields, dairy, cheese factory, fruit canning establishment, etcetera, separate from ranch management.
If you approve, i think interesting adobe farm houses and barns could be built over near castro house or orchard.
Sincerely,
W R Hearst
