Bear Miss Koreans-

Richard Glark suggests locating
Jerseys also chickens, etcetera, on flats near ocean
because feed, water and pasture area available there.

I think we could have Herefords there
too and have farm superintendent to run live stock,
vegetable gardens, corn fields, dairy,,cheese factory,
fruit canning establishment, etcetera, separate from ranch
management.

If you approve, I think interesting adobe

 I . farm houses and barns could be built over near eastro house

or orchard.

Sincerely.
