Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon,
California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The architectural books I picked up for you this winter are stored away in one of the cupboards in the assembly room  There was not time to arrange them.

I used the biggest things available in the assembly room without regard to where they belong and did not put them up properly for any permanent arrangement.  I hope there was no objection.

I will come up for Sunday, unless you would wish some other arrangement.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
