MEMORANDUM FOR MR. JOY
FROM MR. HEARST ------

It is bad to have the place look unfinished unnecessarily.  There are a number of minor things we could clean up almost immediately that would help the general appearance of things.

There is the little new stair from the central plaza.  I do not see why we cannot finish that.  It is in the same condition now that it was in three months ago when I left.

Let us erect the Egyptian statue and cement these steps and get things looking ship-shape.

There is the big terrace in front of C.  I do not see why we should not get that paved and finished.  It would be an attractive feature then instead of rather an ugly eyesore.

The tiling on the towers should be finished as soon as possible so that when the bells come they can be mounted and there will be no reason for not taking down the scaffolding.

That scaffolding does more to make the place look bad than anything else.

There are other rather small matters of this kind.

I have attended to the tennis courts so they will be practically finished, but the stairs there should be cemented and give the proper surface and made to look completed!

I want to plan to do the most needed things before summer arrives, - the things that we are going to need during the summer period.  Chief among these is the dressing room terrace above the pool.  I do not think that we should go into another summer with the inconvenienced that we have had in the past regarding dressing rooms.

I think this can be finished in a couple of months if we get at it and I think it can be finished while we are working on the other terraces in the neighborhood.  In fact this can be given the preference.

If we can get the detailed plans for these dressing rooms, we can begin immediately on them.  I think the plans should include the steps down to the pool and the various features immediately associated with the terrace.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
