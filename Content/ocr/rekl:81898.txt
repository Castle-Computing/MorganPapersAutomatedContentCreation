Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst says:

"The tapestries should not be hanging all the time.  It is more or less a strain on 
them, even with canvass backing.  They should be taken down occasionally and put on 
rollers and rested, and when they are taken down they should be gone over carefully 
for moths or any possible defects."

Sincerely yours,

s/ J. Willicombe
