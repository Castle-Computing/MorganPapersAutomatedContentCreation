Dear Miss Morgan:

I am disappointed in the cloister -- not disappointed in the way you have handled it, which seems to be as good a way as could be devised -- but disappointed in the idea of the cloister.

It seems to me to interfere with the attractions of the wings of the house, as seen from the patio; that is to say it covers up the windows and the other things that made the rear patio look so well in the various drawings which you have sent me.

I think I want to abandon the cloister idea entirely.  I do not think I will try to use the cloister out West.  I have your note saying what you think of the advantages of it, but I do not think these advantages compensate for the very great disadvantage.

I may be wrong about this, but I naturally do not think so.

I think the cloisters with their low roofs would ruin the general effect of the rear patio.  At any rate, please do nothing about putting them up, but try to see how we can make the patio attractive without them.

The question of the grades does not seem to matter so much -- we can step up our walks at different places.

2. I am sending back the plan of the temple garden with the suggestion that we make the pool longer than it is, as long as we can make it in the space, and that we make it eight feet deep so that we can use it as a swimming pool.

Mrs. Hearst and the children are extremely anxious to have a swimming pool, and unwilling to wait until we can get the regular swimming pools build down on our Alhambra Hill.  Therefore, if it seems practicable, please make this a swimming pool -- temporarily at least.

In other respects, the layout of Temple Hill seems excellent.

3. I am still waiting for those front and side elevations.  They never reaches us.  I have no doubt they are quite satisfactory, and you could go ahead without my approval.  But if you wish me to see them I imagine you will have to send another set.

4. The esplanade or promenade or whatever we call it, seems very attractive as laid out.  I have no suggestion to make for its improvement.  I hope we will be able to complete it by the first of 
July -- I mean complete it with its cement walk and walls.

It seems to give a finished touch to the big house, to frame it in, as it were.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
JW
