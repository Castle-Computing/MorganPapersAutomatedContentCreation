[Letter]
(Letterhead: New York American)

April 3, 1921.

Dear Miss Morgan:

We expect to be in San Francisco now about the first of June and to  be down to the ranch about the fifteenth of June.  I hope this will give time to have everything as far as the three houses are concerned pretty well completed.   

I will not attempt to go into the details of furniture, to any extent.   

There are four beds, each with four short posts, which I think would be well placed in the four small rooms of B and C.  The more elaborate beds would naturally go in the larger rooms.   

Mrs. Hearst will like best, I think, the bed with the satin embroidered canopy which I have just lately sent out. The bed for my room I have not yet sent but will mark it in a way to distinguish it when I do send it.   

All the beds should be carefully and completely repaired and restored and fortified so that they will as useable as new beds.  The necessary and proper appurtenances should be added to make possible the use of modern mattresses and all comforts and conveniences.  

I am shipping a very interesting iron bed which I think would be available for one of the larger rooms in C. 

Please distribute the tables, chests of drawers, and, other smaller furniture in any way that seems best.  We can make any rearrangements when we arrive.   

I have sent a considerable shipment of rugs and will follow it in a few days with another. I think we will have enough rugs for all the main houses. and the big rug-- 22 X 45-- I bought for the living room in the main central house.   

I have not found anything particularly good in fixtures, so perhaps you would better proceed and see what you can get in San Francisco.   I will be able to ship a few fixtures and will send photographs on ahead.  

I wrote you about the round pool being preferable to the long pool on account of preserving the big oak.  Of course it would be a shame to lose that fine big tree, if it is the one I have in mind.   

A perfectly round pool without any notable feature does 
not seem very interesting, however, so I hope we will be able to use the Galatea in a way to make it effective.   

Perhaps a pool in a half-circle, with the circular side facing the main house and the Galatea on the straight back of the pool looking towards the house would be a more interesting treatment; or perhaps a wider pool with the Galatea used in a somewhat similar way would be better.   

I am glad you like the Galatea.  I think it is a remarkably good thing and very well suited for this use.   

You were to send me some data about the pergola and the lower retaining wall but nothing of that kind has arrived.   

I am looking for that and for the little model of B.   

I shall order the old Moorish tiles of French's and have them sent promptly. Â I am inclined to think they should be used somewhere in connection with the central circle-- either in the courts of the three little houses or on the terraces of the main house, or in some way where they will show off to good advantage.   

They are pretty important and rather extraordinary in such considerable quantities, and I think we should make an effect with them.   

They would be too much subordinated, I think, if they were put on the terraces of the little houses.  People would not get near enough to them to realize what they were.  Such things are generally accepted on the value that we ourselves put upon them;   and if we put these tiles in a prominent place, they will be recognized as valuable and important.   

There is a Spanish sale here tomorrow-- Monday-- and I think it is about the last of the season. There are not a great many good things but there are some good doors, and I am going to try to get the best ones. 

There are also some window gratings which I will try to get  and a few architectural pieces, useful chiefly for the main house.   

If you are in need of any particular things, please let me know and I will try to pick them up at the shops before I go West.   

You asked about the small bath for Mrs. Hearst's bath room.  I think she would prefer a rather small one to a very large one.   

I telegraphed Humrich as per your request.
I hope you find the Persian tile panel for the center of the front facade of C to take the place of the little della robia Mother and Child that we now have there. I think this panel is a "peach".   

If you move any statuary down to the ranch before I arrive, will you please see that they take extraordinary pains in the packing and transportation, as of course a very slight break in statuary ruins the whole piece and makes it worthless.   

I think that with pains everything can be transported safely.   

Sincerely yours,
s/ W R Hearst
