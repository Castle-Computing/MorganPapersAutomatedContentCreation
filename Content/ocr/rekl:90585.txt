Dear Mr.Hearst:

Thank you for the drawings of the bear Fountain and the copy of the letter from Miss 
Gartner.

While in Italy, I cam across a number os such cruel instances of similar treatment 
of her co-religionists -- people of such fine quality, that the cruelty of it all 
makes on unhappy to think of it, particularly when there is so little a person like 
myself could possibly do.

I like the fountain very much and think that it is ideal for Wyntoon.  It would be 
very interesting if the sculptress could have the opportunity to see it erected as 
well as to "unveil"it.

If there is anything you can think of that I can do,  I would appreciate your letting 
me know.

Very truly yours,
JM:F
