February 27, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Saturday I gathered all the rugs of museum type except those on walls, and packed them carefully in cedar chests in the vault.  I put with these a few of the fine rugs used on the floor at the Hacienda -- runners mostly.  Then arranged for putting the balance of the smaller rugs in chests plainly labeled, 'These rugs may be used as required'.  The others are labeled - 'Not to be used except on Mr. Hearst's personal order'.

A couple of the big modern Hacienda rugs, one 'domestic' and one oriental, I asked Mr. Williams to send down to be re-treated as one looked suspicious to me, and the other had been lying on top of it.

I did not take up the large red one from the Gothic suite floor.

There was an extra heavy north wind, yet with one exception the fireplaces were working well. Went over all the proposed changes in detail with the chimney man and Mr. Rossi together, so as to avoid any possible misunderstanding.  He will do all he can this week and depart at its end.

Yours very truly,
