COPY FOR MISS MORGAN

Sept. 21, 1932.

Dear Mr. Reesing:

I have gone over your list.  I notice that in the sweet peas you do not specify what kind.  
I do not imagine we will have much of a flower show in the sweet pea class if we take any 
old sweet peas.

The Sutton people have a large variety of sweet peas and I think we should order specifically, 
with the idea of getting beautiful varieties and color effects.

2.  I notice the same thing about the gladiola.  You simply order ten thousand gladiola.  It 
does not seem to me that that is the way to order these flowers.

We should carefully select the most beautiful ones and some of the new varieties, with the 
idea again of getting color effects and getting exceptionally beautiful specimens.

I have cut down the number of gladiola to five thousand.

3.  The tulips seem to ave been ordered with discrimination.  I do not know what kind you 
have chosen.  I suppose you have chosen them with due regard to color effects.

I think that in all of these three items above mentioned there should be come consultation 
on the effects to be secured.

I will not be here but you can easily take the matter up with Miss Morgan and Miss Worn.

4. The same suggestion applies to the hyacinths.  I have slightly reduced the number to save 
some money; but if you think you need what you originally ordered, I will not object.

Nevertheless I think the amount as I have modified it will be sufficient.

The important thing is to get the right colors and the right distribution of them and here 
likewise discussion with Miss Morgan and Miss Worn would, I think, be helpful.

5.  The pansies amount to very little in cost, but it is exceedingly important to get the 
finest pansies and the finest colorings and beautiful mixtures.

The pansies this year did not seem to me to be quite as good as they have been on previous 
years.

I think the ordering of the pansies like the ordering of
2


other flowers should be very carefully considered with a view to getting the best effects.

6. There is not mention of begonias in this list; but just in passing I want to say that I have not 
been entirely satisfied with the begonias this year.

The effects and the variety and proportion of extra beautiful flowers do not seem to have been as 
satisfactory as on previous years.

I think a great deal of pains ought to be taken in ordering the begonias to be sure to get the 
right ones, just as we should take pains with the other things I have mentioned.

Furthermore, I do not believe in patronizing any florist that does not give us perfection at all 
times.

If some favored florist gets the idea that we are regular customers no matter what they send us, 
we will naturally not get the best results.

I find in my experience that is the case no matter how big or how little the institution with which 
I deal.

Anyone from the paper manufacturer to the butcher has to be carefully watched to see that they 
deliver at the highest standards.

Suppose we make an appropriation of a thousand dollars for these flowers, and I have written 
Miss Morgan saying that I am willing to make this appropriation; so there will be no further 
holding up of the bill if the character and quality of the flowers are approved.

Sincerely,

W R Hearst

Mr. Louis J. Reesing,
San Simeon, Calif.

P-S  Enclose is the memorandum obeyed for an amount within the appropriation stated.
