Dear Mr. Hearst:

When at the hospital this Monday, the lady with many broken ribs said the 
only thing she hankered for was a little port, and that it could not be had 
in San Luis Obispo, so I took the liberty of asking Albert for a bottle that 
was in the open stock.  I was sure you would be willing, - I don't give away 
your belongings without at least reporting!

Everyone showed much improved general condition.

Yours truly,
