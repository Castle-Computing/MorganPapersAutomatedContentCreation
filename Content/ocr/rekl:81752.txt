Dear Miss Morgan:

I am writing this letter mainly for Miss Worn, but I thought you might like to know 
what I had in mind, so I am addressing it to you.  The various points I am dividing 
into paragraphs.

First, I agree with Miss Worn that it is desirable to have a certain amount of mass 
color, but I think you will lose a great deal of charm and homeliness of a garden if 
you go too far in this direction and confine yourself to any degree to these masses of 
color.  The garden plan then becomes a little too stiff and formal and we lost entirely 
the delightful character of English garden, with its mixed color in what they call the 
herbaceous border.  I think therefore that we should limit ourselves to the general 
color schemes of our various houses and to certain masses of color for different 
effects and otherwise have a garden of sufficient variety.

I think the beds which enclose the Esplanade and the new beds which are being made 
around the main house should be of the varied and varigated type.

I like our petunias in all kinds of mixed colors, and I like the double petunia and the 
quadruple petunia, if there are any such thing.

I like the roses in all varity of colors and also the gladiolas and I think that various 
English flowers from Sutton's catalogue could be combined in the characteristic 
herbaceous border on the inner and upper side of the Esplanade surrounding the main 
house.  In fact I think a profusion and confusion of blooms there would be attractive.

We have to look at that border both from the Esplanade side and from the side of the 
upper terraces toward the main house.  I am enclosing a page from Sutton's catalogue 
marked A, giving a general idea of what I mean.

2.  I think we should have a little more definite plan of just what these sucession of 
blooms is to be in the garden.  I mean, just what the early spring flowers are to be 
and what the early summer flowers are to be and what the late summer and fall flowers 
are to be and what the winter bloom is to be.  I think we should plan to have the 
whole garden flowering all the time or as far as that is possible.

I do not think that we should go in for any very short lived flowers and for that reason 
I am not inclined to pay much attention to the spring tulips and the other flowers that 
flash up for a moment in the very early spring and then disappear. Lets try to make our succession of 
flowers by selecting the more or less enduring ones.

From the time the roses begin blooming until the end of summer I think we are already 
pretty well supplied, but I do not think we are anywhere near sufficiently supplied for 
the fall and winter.  We should have a very glorious assortment of dalias and also a 
splendid array of chrysanthemums.  The asters are also very important in their time and 
have a wonderful beauty and variety.  With such flowers we can carry through November 
but I think we should have a much better plan for December, January and February than 
we now have.

I think we now have planned a profusion of Japanese camelias, a profusion of pansies, 
a goodly number of wall flowers and winter blooming marigolds.  I also think our 
carnations are expected to bloom in winter.  That is a good start, but there are 
doubtless a number of other winter blooming things that we could find if we went out 
after them.

In addition to the flowers, there are a number of winter blooming shrubs.  The 
poinsettias were not supposed to do so well on the hill, because they did not do so 
well the first year, but this second year they are doing marvelously and all apparently 
that is necessary is to give them a little attention from the heavy winds, which whip 
them to pieces.

If we can get through December and January with winter flowers, we can begin to look 
for spring flowers in February.  In fact, many flowers are forced for early blooming.

I wish Miss Worn could give you a little plan for spring, beginning in February and 
running through March and April.

3.  I think it will be necessary to instruct the new gardener about kind of flowers 
that are especially light.  I expect Mr. Eaton can do that in away, if the new gardener 
will pay any attention to it.  Anyhow Miss Worn can instruct him when she goes down again.

I want to make sure that we get all varieties of lilies and an abundance of them.  
In fact I think the Hill should be a lily garden during the lily season.

Miss Worn also decided to use as many tube roses as possible, because they give such 
delightful fragrance and because they last so well.  I think it would be well to make 
a liberal use of wall flowers if they are winter blooming; also the marigolds.  
I have marked a page of Sutton's catalogue B as a reminder.

We have a lovely lot of begonias and I imagine we might get still other varieties 
from Sutton's and I have marked a page C as a reminder for begonias.

In fact I gave Mr. Macklen a whole list of flowers to order from Sutton's and if he 
has not ordered them I think we should order them promptly.  Mr. Eaton may know what 
has became of those Sutton pages.
I think the larkspurs and sweet peas are early spring bloomers.

Finally, I have a mania for hollyhocks and I would like to see them much more 
plentiful in the garden than they have been, especially against the walls of the 
houses.  They begin early and last until late and are a very useful as well as a
 beautiful flower. They also have the home like character, of which I think it is
 necessary to retain some part. I do not now that anything can be said in a general
  way, but anytime that Miss Worn wants to talk over details I will be glad to meet 
  her at the ranch.  Perhaps you could be there at the same time.  It would help if 
  you could.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
