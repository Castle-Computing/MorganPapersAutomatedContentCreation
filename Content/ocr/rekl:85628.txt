Dear Miss Morgan:

I do not see why Mrs. Drew should not be exceedingly successful.

In fact, to be successful it is not necessary to have any more qualities than Mrs. 
O'Brien had.  It is only necessary not to have some of those which made Mrs. O'Brien 
rather annoying.

Mrs. O'Brien conceived herself as a hostess-- not as a housekeeper.  She was frequently 
taking part in games in the guest hall, and not infrequently inaugurating these games, 
especially the poker games-- which she may have found profitable.

She was continually telling the young people up there about the presents other people 
had given her, and indicating about what kind of a present would be most welcome.

If Mrs. Drew will merely attend to her business, I am sure she will be all right and 
will fill the position satisfactorily.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan
