Dear Miss Morgan:

I doubt if the arrangement we have at the warehouse is the best.  It seems to me that the packing boxes are merely kindling wood and a fire would destroy everything.

Moreover, we cannot see what we have in the present arrangement.

I advise that we follow the plan that we have in Los Angeles: divide the warehouse up into sections by means of hollow tile divisions.

Take everything out of the boxes and classify them-- putting the tables together and varguenos together, etc.;  putting the stone work in the largest and most exposed compartment.

Then please build a water tower and have  a sufficient number of stand-pipes, and a great number of Pyrene extinguishers.

Under such an arrangement I do not think a fire could possibly spread.

Furthermore, we would have the opportunity to see the furniture and treat it-- oiling it and waxing it and dong everything to keep the various things in good condition.

I do not know that this arrangement will require any more space, but if it does we will build another warehouse.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
