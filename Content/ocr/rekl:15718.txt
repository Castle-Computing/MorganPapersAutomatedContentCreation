Dear Mr. Hearst:

At the time Mr. Byne sent on the collection of representative photographs of the Almenas Collection you did not want it as a whole and he said it was not to be sold except that way.  A copy of the inventory with the inventory prices of a year ago is enclosed.

It is interesting reading, - to imagine things to fit the fine sounding names.  I think there were some tall thin Gothic saints among those photographed.  He must still have the photographs if you would like them back.

Yours very truly,
