Dear Miss Morgan :

I have bought some stuff at the last auction sale of the season.  I am sending it in a third car, which should arrive in about a month from date.

It contains a pair of excellent doors, carved on both sides, which can be used for the main door of Cottage A.

I am also sending a couple of window grills, matched, which can go over the windows on either side of the door of this house.

I have also found two pairs of matched doors with Renaissance panels, which can go as the entrance doors for House B.

And I am sending a single window grill, not very large but quite fine, to go in the central window of House B between these two pairs of matched doors.

Pairs of doors are difficult to find, so I have not been able to get anything for the entrance doors of House C.  If that house had a single entrance door, I could find doors to fit it; in fact, I know a pair here which would go wonderfully well.  But if we are to have two entrance doors there, we will have to construct them, I think.

They could be made of oak and painted and studded with nails, as I have sent in the various shipments a considerable quantity of old Spanish nails.  Another thing we could do is this:

I bought a very large pair of doors for the rear entrance of the big house-- the doors that lead from the trophy room out to the open.  These are not very fine, but they are pretty big, and it might be possible to divide these and use one door on either side of the court for the entrance to House C. You will see the dimensions in the catalogue that I am sending you.

I have not been able to get any matched fireplaces for the library wings of House A, so I think we will have to put something in cement there temporarily and wait for a chance to buy just the right mantels later.

These wings are not very large and I am afraid the usual big, Italian Renaissance mantel would be overwhelming there.

I am writing abroad to see if I can get a pair comparatively small matched mantels.  If I cannot, I will get one good one and have it duplicated.

The wooden Italian mantels that I sent out I thought we would use for the bedrooms of House B, as they are small.  There is also 
a small stone mantel which could be used on the side in the parlor.

The big stone mantel with the grotesque figures I thought we would use in the trophy room of the big house, and the large red marble mantel in the parlor above the trophy room.

The trophy room  I think we will finish in tapestries and the parlor above it in red velvet.  I have bought all these materials and will bring them out with me.

I have also bought the material for the big living room in the main house.  And  I have bought a lot of Gothic stalls, Gothic pictures, and a big square 15 th century Italian sideboard for the refectory.

I thought we would use the big Gothic fireplace in the refectory, with the crude stone supports; and I would like to use the tremendous Renaissance fireplace in the living room-- the slate stone colored one.

Above this mantel in the living room there is a big contemporary copy of a Murillo, with a nice Spanish frame;  and above the Gothic fireplace I have a fine old Gothic picture which I am having restored a bit before sending to you.

I have also bought twenty-six rather plain, iron and glass lanterns, but they are genuinely old and practical.  Glass will have to be put in in certain places.  I thought we could use these on the court or entrance side of each house-- four lanterns to the house-- like this

This will enable us to light practically all the houses that we will build in this way.  It might be a good thing to have a switch in the main building which could turn all of these on or off, so that when people leave the main building for their houses at night these could all be lighted by this switch and then turned out later when people are supposed to be in bed.

You would better lay electric wires to connect with these lanterns; and it would be well to have the lanterns mounted on hooks or in some way so that they can be taken in and stored away when not in use.

I also bought two fine Hispano Moresque columns of the 12th Century.  They have bases and capitals and consequently I  think they might be even better than the porphyry columns for the loggia of House C.
