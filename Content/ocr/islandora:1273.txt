Mr. William Randolph Hearst,

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I have mailed today ceiling designs for library for House "A", and enclose hall and bed room suggestions.  The lower story has naturally located and sized concrete beams which can be treated as a plain beamed ceiling, or decorated if you think best.

On account of the very strong reflections on the water and the reverse shadows it will cause, I think design #2 is better than #1 as having more flat surface.  Its prototype is in La Audiencia, Zaragoza, which one of the men in the office happened to have drawings of, made when he was in Spain.

That for the hall is a Spanishized version of the ceiling you sent me a cut of.  Those for the bed rooms are also from plates you sent, suggesting a low relief design, cast, with the field in color for which we could make stencils.

I imagine the pair of large doors in the catalogue list are for the main building, as from the description they should fit well into the scheme for the facade.  Have you in mind definite places for the smaller doors?

We have gradually eliminated the porches and pergolas of the courts except that of House "C".  I think the courts can be made larger by cutting back into the hill, and providing a connected treatment of paths etc. - I have several suggestions to make.

Yours very truly,

Enc.
