Dear Miss Morgan: 

I am sending you a light which might be useful in design, and a column which we might use and a suggestion for an aquarium and also a suggestion for some garden ornamentation.

Here also is a suggestion for a vacuum cleaner;  I suppose we should have some such thing on the hill.

I presume you are making some provision for screens for the windows; in fact, there ought to be double casement windows; one with glass and the other with screens.

Sincerely,
s/ W R Hearst
