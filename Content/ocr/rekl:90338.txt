Mr. Thomas J. White
959 Eighth Avenue
New York City

Dear Mr. White:

	We are sending to you today by 
express a copy of the Pacific Coast Card Index
Register -- the nearest thing we can supply to 
fill Mr. Hearst's request last week that we
send you a copy of the Pacific Coast Inventory. 

	Mr. Willicombe added that it 
should be evaluated.

	The copy sent you is a direct
contact print of the Register of which there
was no copy, following Mr. McGregor's instructions
to Mr. Forney who has this work in charge
here. 

	The figures typed in are from
definite data, the pencilled figures estimates
from sales lists, similar items, etc. obtained
in many ways. 

	Where no basis for value was reliable, 
none is entered -- "no data" appearing
in the margin. The average is probably about
right as totaled. 

	If this is not what you want, kindly 
let me know and we will try to provide it. 

	As always, 
	Cordially yours, 
	
	JM:F 
	
	Note:- The inventory values total $5,471,639.14.
