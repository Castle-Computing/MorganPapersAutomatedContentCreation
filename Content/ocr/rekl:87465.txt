May 4, 1933

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The enclosed letter is received from Mr. Michiels.  I believe the new keyboard came 
late last year.

The letters Mr. Michiels refers to were received in November, 1932, and January , 
1933, and were forwarded to Mr. Willicombe and Mr. Sokolow at that time.

Is there anything you would have us do in regard to them?

As always,

Yours truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
