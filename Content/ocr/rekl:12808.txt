Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

1. Speaking of worms, I notices they are very busy on various polychrome statuettes.  As a choice of evils, would you dare let Divet, the furniture mender try t kill them in one or two of the less valuable small figures?

He insists he can do it without hurting the polychrome -- but can assure you he has not been allowed to try his hand.

2. As to the table from the Tolentino sale here, I will send Divet down and have him treat it in the warehouse before it is crated again.  It is very frail.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
