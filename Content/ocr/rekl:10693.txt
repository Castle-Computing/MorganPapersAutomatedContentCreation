Mr. William Randolph Hearst,

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your "annoted" plan has not yet been received back, but working drawings for the excavations, close enough to final for present needs went down last week, and good headway has been made on structural drawings and new studies.

On account of the towers having to hug, or appear to hug, the main roof walls, they could not be pushed out to the extent you telegraphed -- as probably has occurred to you since.  The general massing-up promises finely, and I have an idea for overcoming the door difficulty.  The terraces, (tea and north), will have to be treated in a larger way than in the old studies to overcome a little overgrown feelings, otherwise everything seems to be workable.

As to the work "On Top", the sudden death from botulism of Mr. Kincaid's young foreman delayed starting, and upset Mr. Kincaid very much personally.  I was truly sorry.  Mr. Kincaid showed me yesterday the message he had sent you saying he did not want to go up and why -- which certainly implied lack of willingness on my part to put the "hiring and firing" into his hands.  He explained that he felt that day that he couldn't break away from the Hacienda and go up there without anyone he knew and where the men he was in charge of were more familiar with conditions than he himself.  Pleas do not worry a bit about there being any lack of co-operation, our of willingness to give Mr. Kincaid a 
free hand.  It will be a real relief to have him there.  He is trying to get a man who has worked for him at the Hacienda and whom he likes, to replace his young foreman, and we will try to provide for what this man lacks in experience in re-inforced concrete work.

I don't often want to bother you with this kind of detail, but thought perhaps the facts would relieve you of misgivings while away.

Hoping the trip will be "GREAT".

Sincerely yours,
JM-deM

P.S. Three more of the "dead" bougainvillae yesterday were full of leaves from top to bottom -- I could hardly believe my eyes.
