Dear Mr. Hearst:

Do you want to keep both of the sets of red damask material from French and Company?  Most of the material of one set is in long lengths, that is eighteen to nineteen feet, with a coat of arms at top of each breadth -- quite fine design. The second lot received recently is a brighter red, no special features but good design and condition.

We have also the antique red velvet, very fine, to replace the new material used in your sitting room hanging -- not forgotten.

Yours very truly,
