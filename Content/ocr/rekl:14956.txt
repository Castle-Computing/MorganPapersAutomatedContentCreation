Dear Mr. Hearst:

The customs people insist no ones signature but yours, notaryed - will do.

Very truly yours,

Owner's declaration for painted friezeboards from Mr. Byne.

Mr. Fairchild says better send this to Mr. Hearst at 137 Riverside Drive, especially calling attention to having signature witnessed by notary
