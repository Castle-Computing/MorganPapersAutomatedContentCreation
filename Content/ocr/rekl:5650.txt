Dear Mr. Hearst:

The model of A is shipped today, and that of B is started. They are a pleasure, but quite delicate and slow work.  

Throwing the main building's axis around so as to go through the center of the circle does not interfere with the trees on either side. It makes the monumental steps come nearer House B, and with the new turn opens up an entirely new set of conditions for the treatment of the grounds this side of House B. The wall of the turn comes rather close to the upper corner of the little house and you will probably think it better to omit the path down the side of  this house as its lower garden and terrace can be reached from the house directly.

It looks to me as though it would be better to push the main building back a bit and make the steps up from the new turn very broad and fine, with quite a broad paved area at the top.  One of the trees in the center is small and healthy, the other old,                     - both rooted in rocks. I did have moved oaks as large as the smaller one successfully in Alameda, but the soil was sandy loam.  It would be possible to take out the little tree, trying to save it, and bring the pool more forward then you indicated, thus  keeping the old tree for background.  The Galatea was in the shipment that went to Pleasanton and I have not had a chance yet to see her. I would be glad in a way if she proved too small for the large pool, as while the fountain with the children will fill the decorative need in the court of A, one cannot enthuse about it. there are three or four different ways I can see already of treating the upper space and fountain, more or less formally as you may wish. Enclosed is a "start-off" sketch.  Would you put the fine well-head on the west side of the tea terrace if the large pool is used in front of the main building?   Perhaps the little Spanish well-head 
would be good centering the path end at B, flanked with little pots, and planting. 

The Steamer Nicholson sprung a more serious leak than usual and we  have had no transportation for a month. She will be off the run for another month or more. If successful in getting another boat, would you consider sending your last car's contents down that way? The supervisors are dragging the roads now, which should greatly improve them, but at best they will be very rough trucking this spring.

 Sincerely Yours,
