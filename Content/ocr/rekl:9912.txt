MARCH 24, 1922.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In "clearing up" the Tower at Los Angeles Examiner, I came upon a quantity of plumbing fixtures bought for  you for the bath rooms of the Tower, and in most cases not even uncrated.

Some of the patterns are not the latest, but all are fine substantial fixtures and as there will be a number of places on the Hill where they could be used to advantage and are of no use at the Examiner Building, said we could find use for them if they were shipped via San Pedro to San Simeon.

If I was wrong, it is not too late to countermand.

Yours sincerely,
JM-deM
