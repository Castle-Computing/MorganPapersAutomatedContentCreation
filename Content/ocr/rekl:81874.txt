I WILL BE SATISFIED WITH WHATEVER HEIGHT YOU THINK BEST FOR COLUMNS IN PERGOLA MISS 
WORN WAS ANXIOUS TO HAVE TALL COLUMN AND I IMAGINE SHE WOULD LIKE ONE BEST THAT YOU HAVE
 INDICATED AS MY CHOICE AM QUITE SATISFIED WITH THAT BUT IT IS NOT ESPECIALLY MY CHOICE
  OTHER ONE WITH TEN FOOT HEIGHT WOULD ALSO SATISFY ME IF YOU PREFER IT IF I HAVE TO 
  EXPRESS OPINION BETWEEN THE TWO SHOULD THINK ONE THAT IS TEN FEET FROM CURB UP AND 
  ELEVEN FEET FOUR INCHES FROM PAVEMENT WOULD BE THE BETTER YOU HAVE WRITTEN ON PAPER 
  WE THINK ABOVE IS AS YOU SEE IT I GUESS IT IS=

W R HEARST.
