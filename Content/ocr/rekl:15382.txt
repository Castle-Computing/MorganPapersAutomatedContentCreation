Dear Mr. Hearst:

The more I study over the route from the Ranch up, the more it seems as though the canyon road was the desirable thing -- and tried to get from Mr. Van Winkle and Mr. Tilton an idea of the difference in cost of the two routes.  It seemed to me that wooden ways over the stream could do until such time as you wanted to put in concrete dams and culverts into which much of the cost would go.  I also showed Mr. Van Winkle where I thought you would be willing to allow fill to be dumped -- of course knowing you would understand I was not doing more than suggesting.

While the men are there, may we continue the road around to the cross axe stair?  We have cleaned up the hill on that side, clearing out the way for it.  It will save much dirt later in the year, -- in the finished section.  The place has a torn up effect for the moment, and it would be good to have it over with for good and all.

As always,

Yours very truly,
