Mr.William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

A drawing of the Neptune fountain was mailed you Saturday with a question on it as to whether you see the center divisions as water basins or flower holders.  Mr. Rossi began on this work Monday.

Not yet received

Enclosed with this, is another water supply report which I have held, expecting to send with it a final electric power proposition from the midland Counties Public Service Corporation, who have admitted the injustice of their original proposition to you.  The new proposition they have worked out but have not yet submitted in detail.  It is based on an interest on the money they invest plus consumption bill.  I found from the Railway Commission indirectly what they would consider fair before opening the subject.  It would cost you less than you are paying to run your present plant, not counting either depreciation, enlargements, or replacements.

[Margin Notes]
This is a very good general proposition of course we will accept it.

The reason for Mr. Huber's water report instead of another from Mr.Phillips, is because the present line seems to have been put in impractically, and without effort to make the most possible of the supply.  Mr. Phillips did not want to go over it for us without involving you in a  good deal of expense, which under the circumstances did not seem quite fair.  I have retained Mr.Phillips on the electrical work, as you directed, and if you prefer will gladly have him take charge of the water supply again.

[Margin Notes]
I see no reason for employing Mr.Phillips at all unless you think best, I think he is hasty and not very good.

Mr. Rossi began laying out the new pipe line from the reservoir to the Hill today.  We have been waiting rains for digging the pipe trenches as with soft ground the cost is much reduced.

The gardens this week are lovely in spite of freezing weather at night and very cold north winds.  The only things that have suffered are the sequoias in the Temple area.

The new method of covering the vines is a grand success -- lattice on the sides of the frames and canvas 
on the fronts, as the sun on the glass in previous frames burnt the plants.  All bougainvillea are on mass of bloom.  The two big plants from Niles I finally bought at a reasonable price and Mr.Webb has planted them on the side walls of the "C" fountain court.

The camp is operating again on the reduced schedule as the rains must come soon.  We are paying for the cornice teak and its carvings, tile for roof, tanks for Main Building, pipe, roof tile (now delivered) for the Main Building, back bills for the extra Imperial suite and storage floor material, nursery stock bills, tile work on the new bath rooms, etc.  and can only cut down by spreading these payments along over a longer period -- would you prefer to do this? 

[Margin Notes]
No better (?) than paid
 
It is going to take real activity to have the new rooms of the little houses done by June, and it would be well to get the concrete work on the kitchen wings up as soon as it is feasible to work a larger crew.

[Margin Notes]
Yes, Set concrete work up soon as possible
I think the main rooms  can be done - with the possible exception of B in case we make a sitting room there.

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan
