SAN FRANCISCO, California
I am the son of the late Marcel Michiels, bellfounder in TOURNAI, Belgium, who made the carillon bells for Mr. W.R. Hearst's ranch at San Simeon.
I came over with a friend of mine, expert and installator of electricaly played carillons, in order to install the above mentioned carillon at San Simeon.
Will You be so kind to let me know which day we can go to San Simeon in order to commence the work; any day of the next week will do.
How can we arrive to San Simeon; by train or by car ?? I have Your letter in hands wherein you state that the necessary help will be provided by you also board and lodging while at San Simeon.
At our arrival in San Simeon, I should like to meet your representative in order to decide together where and how the bells are to be placed.
I want to meet also the contractor which will be charged by you to provide us with needed materials.
I am staying here by a belgian friend in Santa Monica where I shall expect your letter.
I am Yours very sincerely,
(Signed) M. Michiel
