Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Trinkkeller is fitting up two 'antiques' for the cloister room fire place screens, and will make one for the Doges Suite out of a semi-gilded grille you authorized the use of sometime ago.  These will be ready soon.

I have kept my hands off the fire places for some time, but have been noticing and studying, and think with you that the original type with shelf to catch down draft, narrowed throat with damper and back carried well up above front lintel, the only fairly sure kind.  If more than one fire place is served by one flue it is against all plans and directions.

I think the fault lay in my making the fireboxes themselves too shallow for the high fire place openings and the chimneys in many cases not high enough.  There were in some cases mitegating circumstances, and in other not-- Anyway, if you are willing, will take them in hand once more and try to have changed this month.

Yours very truly,
