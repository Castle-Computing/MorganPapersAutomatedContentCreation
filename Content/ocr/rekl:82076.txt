Dear Miss Morgan
Mr. Rossi tells me that the two fine trees which he moved to the north terrace are going back very fast and that we are likely to lose them. The gardener agrees with him and says that the reason is that the tree surgeons performed their surgical operations in the spring when the sap was running and also that the operation was too soon after the strain of moving he says he spoke to Mr. [Slattery?] at the time but he should haveto you and to me. Mr. Slattery asked the tree surgeons if it was all right to go ahead and of course they said yes. I supposed they wanted the job. My private opinion is that tree surgeons are a lot of fakes anyhow. i believe our won people could do everything that they do and do it better. Anyhow we will try to do it ourselves next time but I hope we can save the trees.
Sincerely 
W R Hearst
