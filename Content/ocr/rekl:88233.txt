Dear Mr. Hearst:

You have a large collection of Early American furniture at the Shasta warehouse, a 
few pieces in Stringer's warehouse in San Francisco, a considerable number of pieces 
in the deYoung Museums, and a very few pieces in the San Simeon warehouse.

The enclosed cards from the Shasta warehouse inventory, and the list and photographs 
of articles in the other depositories, will give you a complete picture of what you 
have out her not in actual use.

I had intended before summer to perfect the furnishing at "The Bend" by bringing 
together the best pieces in each group, - the last car from New York not having arrived 
until too late to readjust the furniture last July.

I am enclosing also, photographs of the various console tables you have out here not 
in use.  You asked me to do this some time ago.

We will make up other lists for you of warehoused material not definitely assigned, 
as rapidly as possible.

The articles at Wyntoon and in the Shasta warehouse are card-indexed but not all are 
yet photographed.

As always,

Yours very truly,

Enc.
