Dear Mr. Hearst:

Immediately after seeing you in Los Angeles, I took the question of the Exposition casts up with Mr. Neylan and have talked with him several times since, suggesting it might be possible to buy for some nominal sum the entire lot as any other asset of the Exposition.

Am enclosing a letter received today, thinking you might be able to suggest the next step.

Yours very truly,
