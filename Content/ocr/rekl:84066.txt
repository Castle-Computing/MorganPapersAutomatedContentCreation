Dear Mr. Hearst,-

Thank you for the cablegram just received.  At ranch yesterday, looking down, it was a 
great relief to see how many trees were visibly showing life.  Mr. McClenahan's men have 
worked well with Mr. Keep and the area begins to look tidy.  I think using them was the 
quickest and surest way of handling.  There needs to be the road on the side of the 
canyon toward Red Rock both for the fire break, and in order to get the new planting 
in, as this side is where the landscape suffers most.  The heavy shrubbery is gone, 
but undoubtedly will come up again from the roots.

I have spoken for all the cork oaks and small "tin can" size oaks from thernurseries, 
as not many are available, and they can be quickly handled.  There is no use planting 
before the rains, as we are very short for water - Mr. Rossi and Mr. Rankin have hunted 
out a number of small springs to help take the troughs off the main supply.

I think the miserable incinerator would be safest located down on the shore.  Wet 
garbage will not burn with multiple screens, and those allowing the heavy smoke to 
pass allow small fat particles, etc., to pass also. An old truck could be allotted for 
its service.  The sparks blow, or fall, out of the door when the man opens it to feed 
in the refuse, and this danger would always exist.  The incinerator could have been 
enclosed in a "room", as far as this later hazard is concerned.

Mr. Gorgy and a small crew are working on the theatre decorations, the marble seats 
are done on the main terrace and the fountain curb is being set,- this week will 
complete it.  The tennis court and new Tower are well in hand.  The new tower needs, 
of course,the new Gothic study height to make effective, and like the picture.

There has been much work done that does not show.  Outgrown structural and plumbing 
systems just had to be revamped and temporary expedients be done away with.  Another 
two or three weeks and these will be in permanently fine shape.

Yours very truly,


The four plunge ladders are in, the pool cleaned, freshened and refilled.
