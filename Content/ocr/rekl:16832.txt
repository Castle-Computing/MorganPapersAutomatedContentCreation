2.  A miscellaneous collection of pretty and useful odds and ends, Mrs. Lane Leonard.

3.  Useful, but not new enough for regular gifts, knit sacks, bed slippers, and skirts, "embroideries", etcetera, to the old ladies of the Ladies Protection and Relief home.

4.  Another lot to convalescents at The King's Daughters Home, Oakland.

5.  A collection of miscellaneous picture frames of all kinds left after taking out the photographs of friends' children, mostly, and some miscellaneous glass and china left overs not suitable for Hill or ranches -- Santa Barbara Recreation Center's new Inn.

6.  Some Chinese benches and wooden ornaments, the cost of packing and handling which would be more than they could be replace for, to the Young Womens Christian Association of Oakland - who could use with delight.

7.  Some flannel sheets, shirts, etcetera, and other miscellaneous  material usable for making layettes, etcetera, to the San Francisco Needlework Guild.

These gifts were all very welcome and usefully placed.  There are some more of like nature still to be sent out, but the work is nearly done.

Yours very truly,
