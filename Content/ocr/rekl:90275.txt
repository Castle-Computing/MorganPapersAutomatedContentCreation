San Simeon, Cal. 

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	I am sorry the Indian rugs were 
misused at Jolon. 

	Arrangement was carefully made to 
have the three chests containing largely modern 
rugs unpacked and the rugs cleaned and put back 
until I could get back to Jolon. 

	In honor of your trip over, I 
supposed the temptation was too great not to 
put them down. Will see only suitable ones 
are used. 

	This kind of well-intentioned 
mistakes is chief reason of my constant shuttle. 

As always, 

Julia Morgan

Dear Miss Morgan,
	It is not safe to let people handle rugs and blankets who know absolutely nothing 
about them. Ms. Taylor was paralyzed when I told her the fine ones cost so much 
and of course the fine ones are not as showy as the modern ones so she 
put them on the floors
