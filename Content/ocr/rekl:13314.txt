MR WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST

BY CHANCE BUT HEAD IN A DOOR AT SANTA BARBARA YESTERDAY,, SAW COMPANION FRIEZE TO YOURS IN HOUSE A LOBBY SAME HEIGHT COLOR AND BY SAME PAINTER.  THE ARABESQUE HAVE CURTAINS AND FIGURE FANTASY INSTEAD OF ANIMALS HAS THREE CIRCLES TWO WITH SHIELDS AND ONE WITH INTERESTING HEAD.  ONLY SEVENTY FIVE FT OF IT, BUT EXAMINED CAREFULLY AND THINK AN OLD ITALIAN COULD COPY.  MR GRAHAM SAYS IT IS ONLY ONE HALF ORIGINAL FRIEZE OTHER HALF WAS BOUGHT BY CITY OF VENICE FOR ITS MUSEUM.  IT IS WELL MOUNTED FLAT AND WOULD REQUIRE  NO EXPENSE FOR MOUNTING AND REPAIRS AS HOUSE A ONE DID.  SHE ASKS EIGHTEEN HUNDRED FOR IT.  WOULD YOU CONSIDER FOR LIBRARY
