RAIN TO GO STEADY HAVE TOLD ROSSI TO LET MEN OFF WHEN LAST OF PRESENT FORMS ARE FILLED.  PORTER RECONSIDERED AND WILL GO TO SAN SIMEON SOON AS WEATHER FAVORABLE.  A TREE THAT MOST BANKS NOW UGLY IN FORM SOME CAVE EACH RAIN.  PERHAPS MINIATURE PARCHED TERRACING BOTH SIDES ROAD BED IN STEEPER PLACES WOULD BE GOOD.  KEEP INSISTS MUST HAVE TEMPORARY FORMS AROUND SEQUOIA FLAT AND REMAINING HILL OR OTHER OUTSIDE PLANTING.  DEER EAT YOUNG TREES.
