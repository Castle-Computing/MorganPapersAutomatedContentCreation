Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Samuels thinks you would not like to see Mr. Neptune standing up above the B Terrace -- and suggests lowering the basin down enough to allow him to have a wall in back of him.  This could be done by taking out the three sets of steps and continuing the two straight side flights of stairs on down.  We were not able last fall to put the steps in down to the lowest terrace with the paths, etc. planned -- on account of the settling of the fills.  The winter rains have done this, and we were just back at work on this area.  I took the men off temporarily to ask what you would think of Mr. Samuels' suggestion.

I can see the possibility of a very large scale effect.  What we have now is pretty and intimate -- an  entirely different expression.

Speaking of fountains I have mailed various studies for the Main Terrace pool.  It is not a lack of industry -- that has held this work back, but the feeling that the lovely white figure in a setting suitable to her, just because of the modern white delicacy would not "key" with the great facade.  Would you be willing to smooth up the concrete and fill the pool with lilies for this summer, -- or shall we go ahead with one of the designs mailed you yesterday?

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
