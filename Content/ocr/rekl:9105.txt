Dear Miss Morgan:

I am returning the samples, all except one, which is hopelessly bad.  Please select any that you think will go well with the colorings of the various rooms.  I am not there to make comparisons and cannot select intelligently.

My idea was to have the divans which were originally made for the parlor of A returned to the parlor of A and to have other red velvet divan made for B.

In C I thought we should have a green divan and in the lower rooms of A I thought we would use couches; in fact, I bought couch frames-- one in San Francisco which is covered with a good Gothic velvet.  THere is also a rocking chair and a big arm chair in that set.

In Los Angeles I have bought a couple of couches, also a rocking chair and an arm chair.  This Los Angeles furniture is not covered.  It would seem to me well to cover it with Gothic figured velvet of an appropriate color.

The green couch in B could be selected from the solid colored samples that you have sent on to me, or with a green figured velvet.  perhaps the solid color would be better, unless you find something particularly good in a figured velvet, something that will harmonize well with the wall.

2.-- The Frigidier is really a good proposition if it does not consume too much electricity.  It is very useful here in New York.  Would it not be useful in certain places on the Hill Top?

3.--  I am enclosing a little scheme for a bookcase and perhaps for other decoration that we can use in the small rooms on the top of the main building-- when we build it.  Please do not lose this little print.

There is a somewhat similar treatment in the Bavanzati Palace in Florence as per enclosed print; but I think the first one is better.

4.-- Here are some jars.  Would the center one be of use anywhere-- I mean that type?

5.-- What are you going to do for house telephones-- I mean by that, telephones between the houses an connecting with the big house, servants' quarters, etc?  We should have a good system.  Will you kindly make inquiries and find what is the best?
