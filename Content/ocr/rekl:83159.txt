Dear Miss Morgan:

I estimate that the north terrace will be poured this week, and that everything 
connected with it will be finished by the first of December.

I suppose the first floor of the amusement wing will also be poured by that time.

I look forward, therefore, to cutting our expenses in half at the first of December.

We are now running at the rate of $40,000 a month.  I would like to cut that down to 
$20,000 and keep it there during December, January, February and March.

We will than resume outdoor operations, but during these four winter months I think we 
should confine ourselves mainly to indoor operations.

We can finish the indoor pool and other matters in the gymnasium wing.

I do not know what else there may be inside for us to do, but probably there will be
 plenty.

In the spring we can finish the amusement wing and also the help's wing and complete 
the east patio.

I suppose before next year is over we can also build the enclosed tennis court.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
