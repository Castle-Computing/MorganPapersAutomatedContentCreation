Dear Miss Morgan

I arrived at the Grand Central Station at 10 o'clock last night (Wednesday) on a train which was due at 5:25.  This as a day later than I should have arrived due to starting from San francisco without the roll of principal drawing and been compelled to cancel my reservation at the Oakland motel.  In order to use the ticket it was necessary to wait 24 hours.  There was not time to go through of the business of changing the ticket before the departure of the morning train.

I called up Mr. Hearst house this morning.  Mr. H 
was out.  George Thompson later telephoned instructions to meet Mr. Hearst at the Beaux arts apartment Hotel at the 46th St and 6th Avenue at 3 P.M.  I went at the appointed time and waited in van an hour for Mr. Hearst.  Then telephoned and was informed that Mr. hearst was trying to find me.  I left my phone number a second time and was requested by George T. to call up again at 7 P.M., which I did.  Mr. Hearst had not returned.  George thompson told me to call at the Hearst apartment at 11 o'clock tomorrow morning.

s/T.J.
