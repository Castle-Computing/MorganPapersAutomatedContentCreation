[c Nov. 1921]

Dear Mr. H

There are about gals of white Bay State cement casting at San Simeon.  My own experience here with fillers acting on the "size" principal has not been satisfactory.  Using the "Bay State", thinned down, has been more so.  However I am open minded.  What did 
you do on the sample wall of B?

We can use the "Bay State" we have on concrete retaining walls, pergolas, etc. in case it seems best.  I question the economy of "plain" painters from afar.  The men here are more active & used to working full hours if they are held to it at all firmly & we want as few men & as active 
as possible, on acct of having to house & feed them.  Don't forget in your calculations of time that there are elaborate windows and door trims in all rooms - as well as walls of big rooms in C - besides the plain wall surfaces.  Do try to be here alone for a time before Mrs H comes as there is much
pulling together to be done.  

As always,
s/ Julia Morgan
