Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, California

Oct. 8, 1929.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst has told Mr. Chatfield to reorganize his garden staff, dismissing some of 
the young men who are just waterers, and assign his men to certain sections and hold 
them responsible for those sections, just as Tony Raggo is now assigned and performing 
satisfactorily.  Mr. Hearst told him not to let Tony, or young Sebastian or the Heaton 
brothers go, as they are okey in their work.  Mr. Chatfield has replied that he is 
following instructions, and Mr. Hearst has told me to advise you and Miss Worn of the 
situation so that you may have opportunity to make suggestions in the reorganization.

Sincerely,

s/ J Willicombe

P-S  Will you kindly inform Miss Worn?
