Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

these are the samples of available canvas for the Tapestry backings - obtained from the firm who supply French and Company.

It is not too late to cancel the order here if you prefer that the Tapestries be sent East.

Yours very truly,
