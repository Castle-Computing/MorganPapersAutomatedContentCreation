Dear Miss Morgan:

I am not going to do much building on the ranch this year and not going to do what we 
expected to do at Wyntoon.  

I think I will confine the work on the ranch this year to completing what we have 
already undertaken.  That mean finishing the North terrace, which is not very much of 
a job, and finishing the amusement wing, & possibly enclosing the East patio.

The winter looks as if it would be a very stormy one.  The rains came late, but they 
came torrentially and there has been snow on the ranch and snow even in the Sacramento
 Valley.

So I guess we made no mistake in not trying to do any work in January.  If the bad 
weather should continue we might not do  ny work during February.  It would suit me 
just as well to save a little money.  I would, however, like to get the theatre in use 
and I have suggested to Mr. Lundgren that he proceed slowly to do this.  I imagine the 
rough work in this connection will be done by the time you return home and get this 
letter.

I think that during February, March and April we should proceed with a very small force,
 only doing a few things to finish up the various pieces of indoor work.

I would like to see the balcony that looks down on the dining room finished.  I think 
heavy iron supports should be put into some of the larger fireplaces, as two of them 
have already begun to split.

I think the place where Mr. Rossi has his offices should be transformed into a men's 
dressing room, corresponding to the women's dressing room on the other side.  This 
convenience is needed.

Possibly the music room, like the theatre, can be roughly completed and perhaps other
 minor things can be completed, but I do not want to undertake any major construction 
 until the first of May.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
