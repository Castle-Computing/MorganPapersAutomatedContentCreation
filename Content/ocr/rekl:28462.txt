Dear Mr. Hearst:

All are very busy on the Hill.  The pool done - work on the stone facing and Gothic suite going well - and lots to do yet!

We are cleaning up the Gothic suite Lobby (or hall way) so as to make the rooms available in a neat way, and am sure you can count on the use of the suite for this season.  We are not opening or placing the very fine newest purchases, although I ache to, - but want to be sure all work is done in the rooms first before placing them about.  Also thought you might have definite placements in mind.

The housekeeper is taking hold of the care of things in a way that greatly relieves my mind, and the household has a different spirit -- a good, pleasant, competent one.  The butler sent up is not flexible or quick minded enough to fill the position, - but I understand another will be sent up before you come.

It certainly will be pleasant to see you again on the Hill.

Yours very truly,
