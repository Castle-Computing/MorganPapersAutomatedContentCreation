MISS JULIA MORGAN

I WOULD LIKE TO PUT IN THE FIVE INCH GALVANIZED IRON PIPE FROM THE PINE MOUNTAINS THIS 
YEAR AND I THINK POSSIBLY ANOTHER ROUTE SHOULD BE SURVEYED WHICH MIGHT BE LONGER BUT 
WHICH WOULD HAVE BETTER CONTOUR AND NOT PUT SUCH HEAVY STRAIN ON THE PIPES IF YOU 
APPROVE OF THIS WILL YOU SEND THE SURVEYORS AND THE WATER PIPES AS SOON AS CONVENIENT
