Dear Miss Morgan:

The Coast Highway people are going to put a bridge over the Arroya del Puerto, and 
they are going to build it and pay for it; but they thought we might want to design 
something which would be in keeping with the character of our little Spanish village.

If you do anything, it should be simple, of course, but something that would harmonize.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Location of Bridge will be changed if highway is re-routed so this hold in abeyance-
