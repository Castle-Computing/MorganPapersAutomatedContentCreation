Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Fairchild seems to have some doubt about how we are to obtain water for the hill but I feel sure that you understand the matter perfectly.  We are about to bring the water from the big spring, that now goes to the farmhouse, to the hill first and then to the farmhouse.

We must do this by bringing a perfectly good line of four-inch pipe along the crest of the hills from the Marmalejo to some high point above the cattle trough just before that range of hills dips down into the valley.

I think you purpose putting a reservoir there if that point is above our hill-top in altitude, and I feel sure that it is.  Water from this reservoir would flow down to our hill and we could use what we wanted of it, and then send it down by another line of pipe to the existing reservoir on the plateau just above the ranch house.

From that reservoir it could be used for electric lighting just as it is now,m and indeed I think we could use the water where it drops from our hill to that lower reservoir for another lighting plant  quite as well or even better than we can use it below; so that we would have an additional power plant dependent only on our not using up the greater part of the water on the hill.

I am sure I can safely say that we will not use any considerable amount of water on the hill.  I think we can get along with the one-fourth  or one-third of the supply that is now wasted in leakage and have left practically all the water that is now in actual use.

We would not in the first place depend upon this water supply from the big spring.  We would pump water from the spring which we now use, and with a little work, making a reservoir at that springhead, we would get a great deal more water from that spring than we do now.

Moreover, we would only use this water about three months of the year so that even if we used it all and had to depend on a gasoline power plant for our electricity during those three months we would still have water supplied in full and to better advantage for the remainder of the year.

Let me explain, however, why I feel sure we will not use more than the present wastage from the big spring.

First, our present source of supply which we pump from the little spring on the opposite hill has always been 
sufficient for our needs, and more than sufficient, except when construction is going on.

Second, the amount equal to wastage from the big spring added to that would cover our new needs, because I have tried to plan things so as to be economical in the use of water.

We have decided to make our electric light with gasoline power and will use no water for that.

We have decided to plant as many flowers and shrubs and trees and things, which are suitable to dry climates, as possible so that we will not have to give special gardening water to them.

And third, I have tried to plan the fountains and pools so that they will not require much water, and in fact can all be operated by the same water running from one lever to another.

The first and highest pool is in front of the big house, where you are putting Galatea.

The next pools are below that level, such as the low pool of house B, the lower pool of house C, and the two lower pools on the terrace of house A.

Then, finally, the big swimming tank of the bathhouse on the flat is still lower down; and in this series of steps the water can start at the pool in front of the big house, overflow into pipes which lead to the third set of pools. and finally in a pipe which leads down to the big swimming tank in the big-house.

Thus a little water will keep all these pools fresh. And the water does not have to be running all the time, and does not have to wasted at all.

The situation is simply this, that whatever water we do not need for household use and for watering the garden will simply flow in this manner through the pools and fountains down into the big tank in the bath-house, which will act as an upper reservoir for water storage.  The water can be run from this tank down through a lower turbine to the lower tank or reservoir above the farmhouse.

I think all this is practicable, and really means nothing except that the water which now goes directly to that reservoir above the ranch-house will flow past the hill-top and through these various pools and upper reservoirs down to the same lower reservoir.

How much of that water we will use and therefore diminish the supply I cannot surely state until we have tried.  But as I have said, I think it will not be much if any more than the present wastage, especially if we develop a good supplementary supply from the spring we are now using.

My whole plan in these pools has not been to use up water but simply to cause the water to flow past the hill in a way which will be attractive without using up much of it.

I think we should bear this in mind when we are piping these various pools so that we will lead the water from one to another in the way I have stated.

Perhaps I should have described this plan more in detail before but I had an idea that I had made it clear until I received Mr. Fairchild's telegram in which he showed
considerable misconception of the project.

Probably that misconception is his own, and you have thorough understanding of the project.  But in case any further definition and description is required, please let me know and I will do my best to explain it, and to plot it out if you wish.

Sincerely yours,
s/ W R Hearst
