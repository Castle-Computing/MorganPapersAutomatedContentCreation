Mr. W. R. Hearst,
137 riverside drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The set in Living Room of House B will require following material.  I think the antique damask of shade of sample will be just right.

Chairs.
   Seats.14 pieces 2'0" wide x 1' 11" deep.

   Backs.14 pieces (face) (a'3" wide x
               14 pieces (rear) (1' 5" high
Sofas.
   Seats.2 pieces 4'2" wide x 2'5" deep
   Backs.2 pieces (face) (3'9" long x
              2 pieces (rear) (1'6" high

These measures are given in full so that allowance can be made for the repeat of the design.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
