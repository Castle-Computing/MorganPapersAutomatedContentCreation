Dear Miss Morgan:

Here are some stone windows and a stone door offered by Samuels.  The size of the 
windows are shown on the back of the photographs.

These heights are so nearly alike that they would practically balance if used on 
he new tower and we would not have to make a window as we now contemplate doing.

Moreover, these windows are complete, while the window from Brummer has some 
restorations.  Has the window from Brummer arrived?  If not, I will stop it.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
