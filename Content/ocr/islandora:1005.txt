Dear Miss Morgan:

Mrs. Hearst and I felt when we saw the topographical map that the cottages had been moved by Mr. Peck too far down the hill.  Mrs. Hearst felt this especially, but I must say I agreed with her after study of the topographical lines.

The hillside where our cottage is located is exceedingly steep, and gets steeper as you go down the hill.  We feel that if you move the cottage as far down as it was to the 1090 line, the effect of the entrance court would be seriously impaired, and that you would seem to look down into a well more than into a court from the adjacent hilltop.

We feel, too, that the cottages are going to be very attractive when they are finally finished and decorated-- with the pretty carved and colored cornices, and the tiles, and the interesting widow frames, and additions such as the balconies and staircases and marble columns in the pergolas, etc. -- and that they will not be in any way an eyesore on the landscape, but very agreeable features of the landscape.

It would be too bad, therefore, to shove them away off down the hill so that you could see only the tile roofs, and not get the architectural effect of a pleasing group of pretty buildings.

Moreover, we think that the cottages and the big central building containing the assembly hall and refectory should be more or less intimately associated with each other in an architectural group; and that it would be a mistake to hide the cottages so far down under the hill that it would look as if the big building were ashamed of them and as if they had no part of the composition.

They could be treated that way if they were servants' quarters or out-buildings of small importance; but as they are dwelling houses of consequence, and very pretty buildings, I think they should be brought more into the general composition, and treated as attractive features of it.

In fact, I think that when we get the cottages built, we can lay out a plan of walks and flower beds or landscape features of some kind that will bring all the structures together into a harmonious whole.

I look eventually to putting another cottage or two up which will be located and treated with the same purpose-- that is , making them part of the architectural whole.

We have, therefore, as I telegraphed you, located the rear wall of our cottage on the 1095 topographical line, and the rear wall of the cottage opposite-- called Cottage B-- also on the 1095 line, maintaining in each case the same axes 
2.

as you do, as I supposes you aimed them at the best view.

Cottage C, I put on the 1090 line approximately, and moved 8 or 10 feet to the north, getting it farther away from our cottage, and making it practically about equidistant from our cottage and from cottage B.

I think this is desirable, if there are no serious objections.  We do not want any cottage too near us.  I have kept the axis the same, so that if it was fronting the best view before it will still be fronting it, although moved a little to the side.

These locations I feel are about right and unless there is some distinct objections to them, I wish you would go right ahead on this arrangement.

Sincerely yours, 
s/ WR Hearst
