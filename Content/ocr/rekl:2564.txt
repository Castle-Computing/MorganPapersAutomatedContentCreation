THINK TO USE BIG GRILLS ON HOUSE A WE MUST MAKE A DESIGN FOR WHOLE WALL SPACE EMBRACING DOORS AND GRILLS IN ONE DECORATIVE SCHEME SAME THING APPLIES TO B PLEASE TRY THIS IF NOT ADOPTED WE COULD USE THE TWO BIG GRILLS ON FRONT OF BIG HOUSE EACH SIDE OF DOOR AND ONE IN REAR IN CENTER THIS WOULD GIVE NICE VISTA I LIKE THE OLD EFFECT IMMENSELY AND WISH TO
ENJOY IT BUT THE SCALE SEEMS LITTLE LARGE FOR SMALL HOUSES DONT YOU THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ELEVATIONS DRAWN FOR WALL AND VIEW SIDES OF HOUSES A AND C INCLUDING PLACING JARS AND POTS I THINK IT SAVES POSSIBLE RECONSTRUCTION AND ALSO MAKES US CONSIDER EFFECT AS A WHOLE BOTH FROM NEAR AND DISTANT POINTS KINDLY HAVE THESE ELEVATIONS MADE
