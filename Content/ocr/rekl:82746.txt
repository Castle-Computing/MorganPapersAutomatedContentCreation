Dear Miss Morgan:

Your plan for the indoor pool is entirely satisfactory to me and will undoubtedly give 
not only the best practical results but the best appearance.  It will be necessary to 
have the windows in and the Mosaic lining of the pool in.  We can get along with the 
pavement but it might be possible to smooth off the pavement concrete a little bit.  
If it is not practical however don't do it.  Proceed entirely as you have indicated.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
