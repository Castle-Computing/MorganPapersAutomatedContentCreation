Dear Mr. Hearst:

Little disappointments lead to bigger misunderstandings and should be carefully 
considered before passing over them.

I feel that you were grievously disappointed with the work at the Red Rock borrow 
pit on China Hill and with the construction of the new road down the hill.  You were 
very kind for after recovering form the first shock you lead me to believe that the 
road at least, was best as is, even though some landscaping might be necessary to 
cover the scars.

Except for the fact that I enjoy working with and for you personally and Miss Morgan 
there is not a great deal of pleasure connected with working on the hilltop.  
Pleasing you and thereby giving you a certain amount of happiness, I consider to 
be more important than the actual construction on this Hilltop.

I feel that we have selected the most directed route down the hill and decidedly 
the most economical.  The total cost of the new road to date is less than $1300 plus 
some equipment rental.  There is nearly 1 1/2 miles of new road and it will take 
comparatively little more work to complete it.

I hope we can solve the Ugly Scar on China Hill on the spot.  If what we've started 
is not the proper solution it is easy to undo what we did recently for the shovel
 worked but one day and we removed only enough rock to pave the giraffe yard and 
 the garages.

Was the final decision that I would correct the stretch of old road from our new 
road to the Greek?  I remember you saying it was proper to fix that hairpin turn 
but I'm not quite certain about the widening and grading of the balance.

s/ Geo. Loorz
