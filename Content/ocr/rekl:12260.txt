Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

You are right in regard to the little models.  They are quite accurate studies as to the dimensions and proportions, but are not studies in detail.  In fact, most of that shown was my own handiwork with a "jabber", to give the idea of the openings, etc., the photographs bringing out these with unexpected crudity.

We have a good many elements to bring together if all the motifs "saved up" are used, and it will be a pleasure to go over these with you.  The main structural designing is out of the way, and sheets so arranged, that changes of detail will not delay work on the frame.  Work has begun on the concrete footings, although all excavations are not complete.

sincerely yours,
JM:BH
