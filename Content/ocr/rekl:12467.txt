Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As telegraphed before leaving San Luis Obispo this morning, the pouring can be stopped at the half way level of the first story.  The re-enforcing steel for the columns of this story is continuous from the footing up to the second floor level, sot hat the upper half will be left out from the walls, but could not do any damage, and would only be damaged to the extent of the rusting.

we are short of medium size rugs.  None we have go well in your new room.  Also, -- if you could pick up some more small comfortable chairs, like the blue ones in Mrs. Hearst's room, it could help greatly.  The brocades came from French's for the house B chairs.  Could we use the chairs now in the Pleasanton warehouse?

The damage done to palms by the wind was chiefly to the tops.  Nothing hurt the Washingtonian, Phoenix canaries, or chamrock palms either last winter or in this storm, beyond temporarily trussing up.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
