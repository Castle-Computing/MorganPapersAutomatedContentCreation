Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday was spent on the Hill, 'programming' chiefly, and checking up on what will be possible to get into shape in three weeks.

Three-quarters of the west side of the Neptune Pool area has been poured; the balance will be in by tonight.  It is evident that if Mr. Rossi can make ready and pour the east side of the pool area (balancing the west side), which I think can be done, he will not be able to construct either of the secondary stairways.  If he attempts these and cannot complete, the area toward 'B' House now looking fairly well will be upheaved.  If he concentrates all effort on the east area and gets it poured, the broad new terrace will be effective even in the concrete.  Does this seem, to you, the proper program?

The house movers and equipment for the tree moving should be on the Hill tomorrow. A number of men are working on the new South Terrace and esplanade area.  This whole area is upheaved at present, but will be in shape three weeks from now.

Mr. Rossi lost a number of men last month, some due to the clearing out of undesirables, some through objections on the men's part to being photographed for the cards, so that he has not yet all the new men you allowed, but expects the full quota this week.

The tentative salt water layout for your consideration will be ready by the end of this week.

Yours very truly,
