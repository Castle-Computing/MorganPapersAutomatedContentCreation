Dear Mr. Hearst:

I transmitted your telegram and ideas generally to Miss Worn and she agrees that some better arrangement is necessary.  She is temproarily under the weather or would have come up to see you today.  One reason of course for her irregularity in coming is that her weddings, christenings, funerals, etc. come as they happen to.  The Hill work has been an experiment, if you think her efforts in the right direction, I imagine the question of the time and definiteness of visits would depend on whether the work paid as well as her purely decorative work.  If she were in charge, consulted with you frequently and directly, and had the gardeners under her, without a head gardener, perhaps she could get together picked men - each for his own specialty.

In the meantime am seeing again what can be had in way of a young landscape man.  Lockwood De Forest at Santa Barbara is the most promising one I know, but is not just right.

Yours very truly,
