Dear Miss Morgan:

I think I will be able to be at the ranch next Sunday morning and hope to see you 
there if it is convenient for you.

We will continue to send the amounts you mentioned during January and I think we can 
send $15,000 in February and $15,000 in March.

I do not believe we will begin work until the first of April as I would like to use 
the money clearing up these back bills.

Furthermore, we are having a wet year and I do not believe outside work will be 
possible before April.

We can nevertheless proceed with the interior right along, not incurring a great 
deal of expense doing so.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
