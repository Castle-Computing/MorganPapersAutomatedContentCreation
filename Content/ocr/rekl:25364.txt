Dear Miss Morgan:

Please get estimates on pumping salt water up to the Hill.

I suppose the way to get the salt water would be through the sand as we do at Santa Monica, thus having it strained and clear.  I figure we would have to have three pumping stations.  I do not think we would have to have a reservoir.  The pool itself would be the reservoir.

2. I have an idea for a winter pool.

We could put a big hot-house down where we were going to build the Persian Garden, and in the middle of this hot-house we could have a big pool about the size of our present pool.

In the hot-house, sufficiently back from the pool, we would have palms, ferns and a whole lot of orchids.  In fact, it would be mainly an orchid hot-house.

I think these would form a wonderful background for a pool, and of course they could just as well be raised in this kind of a hot-house as in any other kind.

The temperature of the hot-house, and of the pool, too, would be warm on the coldest, bleakest winter day.

We would have the South Sea Islands on the Hill.

This would enable us to build an architectural hot-house, something that would be beautiful inside and out.  We could have a dome over the middle.  We would have to use a lot of glass, of course, but it could be green glass; and the iron frames could be gilded; and we could get a good oriental effect.

I think the concrete walls could be made fairly high, and we could have latticed windows as in that picture of the harem that we were looking at when discussing the Turkish bath.

Towards the sea there could be big rest rooms, and a loggia.  Here we could serve tea or poi, or whatever the situation called for.  The pool, of course, would be the main attraction; and we might put a turtle and a couple of sharks in to lend versimilitude.

This, except for the sharks, is not as impractical a proposition as it might seem.  It is merely making a hot-house useful, and making a pool beautiful.

Sincerely,
