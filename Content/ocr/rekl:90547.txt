Dear Miss Morgan:

	Acknowledging your letter of
September 7th, Chief asks that you kindly send to 
New York the colored chalk sketches of Mount Olive. 

	He also instructs me to thank you 
for your suggestion about "presenting not only the
castle material, pictures, or layout, but with it
photographs of the parts originally planned to use,"
etcetera, with locations noted on plan and identification
on the photographs, -- itens to include everything
you mentioned in third paragraph of your letter
excepting THE FIFTY FOOT SPANISH REJA

	2. Mr. Hearst says, -- "Certainly
if we sell Miss Morgan should have the cost of drawings"

	I am sending a copy of this letter to 
Mr. White so that he will know what you are planning to 
send him. 

	Sincerely yours,
	
	J. WILLICOMBE
