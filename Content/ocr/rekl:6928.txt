Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards garden progress; A large shipment of plants, as near as  per list as obtainable, went down Saturday on the little gas  schooner finally chartered for you. A landscape man, Gardiner  Dailey, who had his architectural training in this office some  years, ago, went down to meet them and see they were properly  handled and placed. He has fine experience in Mexico and South  America, knows European gardens and is a plant enthusiast. Our  practical gardener threw up his hands and departed. Dailey is  taking down another man tonight. The labor already up there  is used for handling dirt, making beds, etc. so no other special men  are needed. Most of the good gardeners available have families  which is not practical for the top at present.  

The roots of the very old oak in the center of the plaza are so  interwoven with the rocks it is not likely it would survive  removal. The younger oak might possibly, if enough time were given  it to grow new roots before lifting it, although no one holds out  any encouragement who has seen it. One of the other oaks needs a tree doctor very soon, as the split it originally had has been much widened by the winter's storms. Mr. Dailey suggests a rod run through each trunk, the two rods joined by a chain, which allow a  certain amount of play while stopping the strain.  

I enclose an alternate study for a long pool for the plaza, as  requested.  

Yours very truly,
