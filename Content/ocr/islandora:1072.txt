PLANS RECEIVED DONT QUITE LIKE UPPER WINDOWS IN PENCIL SKETCH REAR ELEVATION NUMBER TWO HOUSE A PREFER MOORISH TREATMENT SINGLE OF DOUBLE WINDOWS FOR UPPER WINDOWS AND MOORISH ARCHES BELOW IN LOGGIA OR ELSE RENAISSANCE WINDOWS WITH PUTTI  ABOVE AS ON RIGHT OF BLUE PRINT REAR ELEVATION NUMBER ONE WE SHOULD THEN HAVE RENAISSANCE TREATMENT OF LOGGIA ARCHES WITH CARTOUCHES OVER COLUMNS ETC I THINK THE CORNICE IN SKETCH NUMBER 
TWO IS TOO HEAVY AND FORMAL FOR SMALL HOUSES I LIKE CORNICE AND FRIEZE IN SKETCH ONE LOTS BETTER BUT I THINK CORNICE OF PAGE 84 WHITTELSEY IS STILL BETTER AS IT RAISES THE ROOF EFFECTIVELY I LIKE THE GABLED ROOF IN SKETCH TWO BETTER ALTHOUGH IT IS NOT QUITE AS GENUINELY SPANISH STILL I THINK IT IS MORE GRACEFUL I SUPPOSE RENAISSANCE TREATMENT OF FALL HOUSES IS SAFEST AND SHOULD BE ADOPTED BUT PLEASE SEND SKETCHES OF BOTH RENAISSANCE AND MOORISH TREATMENTS PLEASE NOTE MOORISH WINDOWS ON PAGE 102 EXTERIOR OF VIEW AND PAGE
