Nov. 5, 1928.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Sunday Chief wanted to go into the pool.  He did go in and nearly froze to death-- 
likewise his guests.

Nobody was on the Hill to heat the water.  Mr. Rankin had gone to Oakland-- Thompson 
and Madison (Rankin's assistants) had taken the day off.

Thompson said Mr. Rossi told him and Madison that nobody would use the pool Sunday; 
also that Rankin had confirmed this.  

Mr. Rankin told me on telephone that the two men were away without his knowledge.

Chief assigned Thompson today to be responsible for the heating and cleaning and general
 care of the pool.  This letter enclosed would seem to indicate that he would like 
 Slattery or someone over Thompson.  By Chief's instruction I have told Slattery of 
 his wishes and asked him to communicate with you.

Chief told me to tell Rankin not to come back on the Hill.  I conveyed this message to 
Rankin, tactfully, and suggested that he talk with you before returning.

Ranking told me that he had been told by Rossi that the pool would not be needed Sunday.

Rossi says he did not issue any such instructions, but states that he did not believe, 
on account of the rainy, chilly weather, that the pool would be needed.

I think if Thompson under Slattery's or Rossi's direction is held responsible it will
 avoid recurrence of the incident which greatly upset Chief.

Regards Sincerely,

s/ J Willicombe

P-S  Maybe you can get Chief to rescind his order for Rankin not to return.  I will
 have another talk with Chief about it. But you also will undoubtedly want to discuss
  it.
