Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The social room ceiling is all brought together to match the old par t-- the mantel up -- the main decorative doorway opposite the fireplace set up with the temporary extension for you to judge of before fixing permanently:  the two marble door frames are up, windows in, and floor is being laid and will be finished next week.  I have made temporary arches in the refectory as the doors are not done.  The panels are carved to go with the originals ( a good piece of work ), but I do not dare make them up into doors until the wainscot is decided upon as the fit of the wainscot will have to be recalled some way in the treatment of the doors.  This applies also to the seats under the windows, (not made).  I have thought out how to furnish the social room using the things now out here and have it ready for you, using choir stalls, etc. now here in a temporary way.  The building is going to eat up furnishings like an ogre.

As there could not be time to made individual doors for the cloister rooms,  and as you have so many coming from the Ruiz sale, I have invented a quick cheap way of getting temporary ones interesting enough not to be incongruous with the furniture.

The Camp is a very busy place and I have been overtraining people in order to get into usable shape everything you wished.,  As only the Byne ceiling is here, I am not trying to get any ceilings up, but will have canvas ones.  Baths, hot water and commissary are assured.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
