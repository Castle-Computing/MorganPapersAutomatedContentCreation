Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your suggestion that the Tavernier painting had been taken out and packed separately 
from the frame gave me an idea, and last night, hunting through Mr. Fairchild's notes, 
I found a long telegram of instructions from you to him, in which occurs this item:-

"PACK VERY CAREFULLY ALL PICTURES THE PICTURE IN ONE BOX GLASS AND FRAME IN ANOTHER 
THIS AVOIDS DAMAGE STOP MARK BOXES CLEARLY NAME AND CHARACTER OF PICTURE AND DESIGNATE 
GLASS THAT FITS IT WILL LATER SELECT SOME PICTURES FOR SAN SIMEON"

Your instructions were evidently not followed as far as marking the boxes with the 
exact nature of the contents.

It is possible that this picture, being small, may be packed in a case with a larger 
picture.  Next rip to the Hill I will have Mr. Williams open any case that has been 
long warehoused.

Very truly yours,

The condition of the damaged frames still suggests something unusual J.M.
