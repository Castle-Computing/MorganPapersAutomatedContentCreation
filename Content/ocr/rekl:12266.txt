Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The little temple is much larger in scale than the pepper boxes - the reason for their suggested "shrubbing out" on the enclosed plot.  The new English gardener is thoroughly capable, but his squarely built neck takes the form of rebelling at taking chances on the planting in this area at this season.

As to furniture:  The new comfortable seats and backs are made for the blue-green and gold set, house B.  I had held the choice of the cover material for you to see, as literally dozens of samples have been tried out in the room, and the only one really satisfactory to my eye is an antiqued old gold brocade, and design of the period of the chairs.  Shall I go ahead with this?

As to Mrs. Hearst's set:  It requires so much material, that there is nothing I can find with nearly sufficient yardage in your collection, although there is a suitable and very pretty blue and white piece.  The material on the set was in shreds - some lacking - coverings entirely, and two backs caned. It would be possible to make a full set of seats with medallion centers and embroidered edges and a full set of chair backs, if the settees were both cane backed.  The new silk could be toned to the old color.  The embroidery is beautiful in the bands.  I enclose a sample medallion to refresh your eye.  It looked to me valuable, as the embroidery would cost today many hundreds of dollars.

The first footings on the main building are being poured.  I saw the "B" new grille doors in Los Angeles yesterday, nearly done.  Mr. Trinkeller has done a beautiful piece of work.

Sincerely yours,

JM:BH
Enc.
