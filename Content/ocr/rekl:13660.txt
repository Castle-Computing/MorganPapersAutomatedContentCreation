Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed at last is the proposal of the Midland Counties Public Service Corporation for Electrical service.

They will have men on the line the 12th of June if we have the contract and $11,000. ready on the 1st of June.

On the ranch are three miles of poles and lines in good condition, and one to two miles, principally those from the ranch house to San Simeon, and from the ranch house to the power house, in very poor shape.  There ar a number of transformers in perfect condition, and it looks as though our estimate for the complete installation was ample.

In going into costs carefully, I believe it will be economical to have the Power Company lend us their men and appliances on completing the main line, to finish out the high power portion of line on your property and set the transformers.  They are willing to do this.

Water:     Yesterday I had Mr. Huber, the engineer whose report you approved, go with Mr. Rossi over the whole pip line once more, following your suggestion of sweeping, where it was obviously possible, with the contour rather than making always straight lines with its consequent deep "V's" in the gulleys.  They report that the Pine Mountain Springs are not running enough water to fill the present Pine Mountain water line and that larger pipe or reservoir capacity ill be of no service to the Hill probably this year.
The new catch basin at the spring and the mending of a broken section of the Chisholm Spring line would be all that would be effective on that line this summer.  The present reservoir has not, so far as known, been full this winter.  Gardens nd orchard were practically watered all winter.

The expense of the Pine Mountain pipe line and reservoir could be put into the fall if you wish.

Yours very truly,

JM:G
