Mr. Willicombe telephoned - said
Mr. Hearst didn't want to urge you, but
if you cared to go down to see him,
he would very much like to have you.
Plane is at Monterey awaiting word, should
you care to fly down today.

Mr. Hearst didn't even know you were
at San Simeon and was disappointed that
he hadn't seen you. â€œjust had a cold"
