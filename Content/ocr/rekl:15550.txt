Think verdeantique would be handsome for big pool and brocatello for small pool and cascade with use of some recall of verdeantiuque in decorative feature of cascade basins. Will need two carloads for ranch pools alone Vermont Marble Companys headquarters New York wired coast representatives today they can be ship first car in three to four weeks Suggest taking shipping up directly with New York office. Saw Maybeck after you phoned. He thinks verdeantique for University pools with pavement largely brocadillo with verdeantques in borders etc very fine, period work on first contract is done and all bids are in for work to complete. Shall I hold until you return and bring down to Los Angeles with pool model or mail you New York. They cover plumbing heating painting etc.
