Dear Miss Morgan:

I am extremely sorry that the second plane was delayed so long.  I should have taken 
you on the Vultee to San Francisco, and the only reason I did not was because both 
Miss Davies and Mr. Pogany were so anxious to get to Los Angeles before the studios 
closed.

Miss Davies should have reported Monday, but I held her over to discuss things with 
you and Mr. Pogany.  She was therefore doubly anxious to report Tuesday.

Nevertheless I am sorry that I did not take you to San Francisco and then go to Los 
Angeles.  I think we still could have made it, and I surely would have done this if 
I had known that there would be so much delay.

I thought that the other car was on its way and would arrive any moment.  Please 
pardon the inconvenience I caused you.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
