November 10, 1928.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst gave me the following message in reply to your letter of the sixth, and I 
am putting it in this form instead of telegraphing it so that you will get it when 
you arrive on the Hill Sunday:

MR. HEARST SAID --

"I think we will continue to December 22 to finish various incomplete projects.

2.	Slattery thinks he has competent gardner.

3.	Agree with you, fine mechanical equipment should be operated by distinctly first-
class man.

4.	Obviously Rossi entirely responsible for pool-heating incident; but his only makes 
it more desirable to confine him closely to construction.

5.	I do not think either Rossi or Slattery should have authority to institute changes 
or make any radical departures from established program.

Slattery equally to blame in the case of the gardens."

I hope this will be satisfactory way of getting this message to you.

Sincerely yours,

s/ J Willicombe
