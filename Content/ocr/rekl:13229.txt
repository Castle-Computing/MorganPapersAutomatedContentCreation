December 3, 1923.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst.
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Were the double sequoia gigantea and the other four trees you bought at Niles for particular spots -- or general use?  I have located all the other items on the order according to the general ideas discussed.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
