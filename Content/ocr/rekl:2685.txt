Mr. WIlliam Randolph Hearst
137 Riverside Drive
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The cook and this helper started an avalanche by stating they were going to take a two weeks vacation, leaving on the 18th.  Mr. Washburn tried to stem it by offering to bring in a substitute, but was unable to do so, and it seems best to let every one come down except Mr. Humrich's workmen.  (The dishwasher has agreed to cook for them)

Van Der Loo's crew has the cornices, window and door details, etc. for House  "A" except the lobby motives at the ends which await the new column measurements.  They cannot be set, or the walls finished, until we get the depth of the new main room ceiling.  Is there any news of this yet?

The fireplaces have been made full size of the stone openings and trial linings put in.  They seem to draw well, but to make sure, Mr. Peck has agreed to make fires in all kinds of weather, before we put in the permanent  backs.

The antiques are almost complete in the main room of "B" and are really excellent, as are the window decorations in the large bedroom of "C" the little figures in the cornices have come out finely.

The unexpectedly continuous rains have made bad work of the roads, but a couple of days in succession of good weather does wonders in drying up.
