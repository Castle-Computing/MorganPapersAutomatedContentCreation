Dear Miss Morgan:

About water:

1.  I want to build a dam above the alfalfa field at the ranch house.  I want it 30 feet high and Mr. Rossi has had some preliminary surveys made.  I think the dam will cost about $30,000.  I would like to see the dam under construction and have the contract let as soon as convenient.

[?] ready for a slightly  [?] than present one which could adapt to this

2.  I think we should have a bigger reservoir, or reservoirs, on Reservoir Hill, big enough to hold a considerable reserve of water.  I think these reservoirs should be located with relation to what we intend to build in connection with the reservoirs, perhaps two reservoirs, making two pools with a cascade between them would be good, and we could have a handsome fountain in the first reservoir where the water comes out of the pipe from the springs.

Perhaps both of these reservoirs could be placed in the court of the observatory.  I should think that would be the best arrangement.

3. spoke to Mr. H regards this and agreed on ordering pipe after 1st of year and putting in before summer.

3.  I think we should proceed more or less immediately to put in a big pipe from the spring to the reservoir on the hill.  I understand that our present pipe does not give us the utmost capacity of the springs, but that a big, six inch pipe, conducted on a little different route, would give us considerable more flow.

I am told that there are also some other springs that could be tapped up there, but I am not sure about this.

Talked over with Mr. H and a court plant agreed upon.
4.  Now about the house here:  I doubt if we have got the right general scheme for the servants' quarters.  We have to consider what to do with the house servants and also what to do with the men around the place,  gardners, chauffeurs, stablemen, cooks and waiters.  Then again, what to do with some of the immediate house servants.

Furthermore, it may be necessary eventually to have somebody like Kincaid up here to look after the place, with authority to let people go if they don't behave and do their work properly.

In view of all these requirements, more or less varied in character, I think we will have to make a new attack on the problem and probably put one house where we thought of putting it, but making the house a little different character, 

more like the present houses, and putting the regular servants house over on the flat where we are now putting the storehouse.  We could have a colony over there, as I have made that flat quite big.

5.  In view of the delays in solving the servants' problem, I think we should go ahead promptly and pour the north wing of the big house.  I think we should put enough men on to do that work quickly.  The extra expense would not be great and the progress would be worthwhile.  We could then spend the winter months in doing the interior of the house.  We can then take more time on the servants situation and try to get that plan right.  I would like to get as many as possible over on the warehouse flat and as few as possible on this hill.

Perhaps the iron railing and our pulpit outside.

6.  I have asked Rossi to put a temporary wood dove cote on the roof of the kitchen.  I think perhaps that is the best place to put the permanent dove cote, in which case I think it would be well to carry the stairs in that servants' wing, that now come in from the basement, on up to the roof.

7.  One room that I am very anxious to finish in the interior of the big house is the library.  We now have a very definite idea of what we want to do concerning it, have decided on the ceiling and the shelves and the decorations generally.  Therefore I would like to see enough men put on to finish it.

I don't think there will be much trouble in finishing the Doges suite or the big refectory or the entrance hall and lobby.  We must give some more thought to the big assembly room and to the Gothic suite.

8.  I feel sure that we could have a handsome fountain below the swimming pool the other side of the big laurel and just above the road, and I wonder if we could not use the pumping station and filtering station that we are putting in in connection with the cascade, the swimming pool and this fountain.

I think a fine statuary group for that fountain would be either Pluto carrying off Proserpine or Apollo and Dophne, or perhaps a group of Diana and Actenn.  I think we can get models for all of these.

9.  Down near the Sycamores there is quite a spring in front of House A.  At present it merely seeps through the ground and makes a marshy place.  If it were properly developed we could get enough water out of it to carry in a pipe down to where the wild animals need a trough, and at the same time we could dry up this disagreeable little marsh.

I wish you would employ somebody who knows 

to do this thing.

10.  I would like to have somewhere on the place a labyrinth or maze.  They are lots of fun and can be made very pretty also.

Another interesting thing is a theatre with wings out of clipped ewes.

11.  Don't you think the columns in the Sarcophagi and the hall marble should be covered with wax or some covering, exactly as we covered the statuary.

12.  Should we not consider indirect lighting for the tower tops?

13.  I have told the gardner to experiment with plumbaga and climbing roses and heliotrope and Santa Barbara poppy along the road at the cross roads below Chinese Hill.  It think these flowers will take care of themselves and will grow exceedingly well.

Then I would like a row of flowering trees planted above this wide border, preferably the Red Eucalyptus.

In that way we can have an effect which will be striking even at a distance.

14.  I have an idea for a swimming pool and beach house right down on the rocks of the beach instead of pumping the water up from the bay to the ranch house.  If you will remind me I will talk to you about that.  I think it would be very delightful.

15.  How are we going to deal with the water in the pool at the Chinese house.  Is it going to be any part of the system that we are now installing for the bathing pool.  I mean, can the same pumps do the same work.  Perhaps we should plan to arrange it so.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
