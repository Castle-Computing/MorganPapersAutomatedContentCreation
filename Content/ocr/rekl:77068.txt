Dear Miss Morgan:

Mrs. Hearst and her party will be here the latter part of this month and after they arrive I would like to cut down on ranch expenses.

I want to get as much as possible done by the early part of April.

I would like to get the dressing room terrace finished.

After that we can keep our expenses down.

You are now getting $40,000 per month from Mr. Neylan.

I think we could reduce that to $30,000, and still make some progress.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
