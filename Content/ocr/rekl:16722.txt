Dear Miss Morgan:

I am quite satisfied to have curtains-- like at the end of the refectory-- for the entrance to the assembly room.  We will not have any grill.

2.  I am glad you agree about the big doors.  I think they will not only give a good appearance but will tend to shut out the drafts.  Drafts up here when the wind is blowing are intensely disagreeable and of course somewhat menacing to health.

3.  I really do not think the sash is heavy enough in any of the houses.  Of course it would be under ordinary circumstances, but the circumstances on the Hill are not ordinary.

I have never seen anything as severe as the onslaught of these storms.  The only thing I can liken them to is a storm at sea, and I think we should provide against this onslaught just as we would provide on a boat against a storm at sea, with extraordinarily heavy protections.

I think, therefore, that the sash should be heavy and the plate glass heavy, and the windows not necessary to open should be sealed in;  and windows that should open should be double and have extraordinarily heavy sash and glass.

Furthermore, I think the bolts should be on the outside windows as well as on the inside windows, and that every possible protection in the way of seals and weatherstripping should be taken.

There is no use of half-way measures because we are likely to have only half-way comfort.

4.  I rather think that the sash on the non-exposed sides of the houses should be as heavy as the sash, glass, etcetera, on the exposed sides.  Of course this is not absolutely necessary;  but I think it is desirable.

We do not have many storms from the north, but we have some, and why not be fully protected.  For instance, I have asked Mr. Rossi to put up heavy frames with plate glass along the outside corridor of the cloister rooms and to put these frames up on both sides, the north as well as the south side.

There should furthermore be the same attention given to protecting the cloister rooms as is given to protecting the rooms in House A.  The heavy glass frames on the outside of the corridor which Mr. Rossi will put up are only the outside windows.  The inside windows and doors should be made draft-proof, so that the people in the rooms will be cozy and comfortable.

At present the cloister rooms are merely funnels for the drafts, and the only way anyone can be comfortable in them is in bed-- I mean of course during periods of storm.

5.  I feel confident after my own architectural efforts in designs for the wings, that we can get five rooms at least with comfortable bathrooms and clothes closets, etc.  This would be a great help to the big house

On the other wing-- the servants' wing-- we cannot get the rooms so large;  but we can get them large enough. And those servants' rooms will help a great deal to relieve the discomforts which our best help now experience, and which make it difficult to keep them on the Hill.

The second story to these wings will be a big benefit all around.

6.  I think Garage Hill should be fully occupied.  I think we have not use for everything that we will put up-- in occupying it-- but we soon will have use for it, as the requirements of this place seem to grow.

I am inclined to think if we have space enough that two courts would be better than one-- one a distinctly automobile court, towards the west side, where the automobile could be washed, etc.-- and a larger court towards the east side, which would be the general court for the construction men.

I have seen one of the famous storms on the Hill all right, and I am inclined to think from the damage that the storm did all around us-- to the roads and railroads and even to the cities, like Los Angeles-- that it must have been one of the best storms that has ever hit the Hill.

The pressure of the wind was so great that I could actually feel it in my ears inside the house.

Mr. Swinnerton, who had the southeast room in House C, was up all night expecting the windows to blow in.  The did not;  but they did leak a good deal.

I have arranged with Mr. Rossi, subject to your approval, to put solid panes of plate glass in two of the south windows in my room and two in Mrs. Hearst's room; in the two side windows of each of the rear rooms of House C, and in the two side windows of each of the east rooms of House C.

Miss Morgan -- 3.

In the east rooms of House C, merely the middle windows will swing open.  In the west rooms of House C the very middle window will be sealed but the front windows on each side of it will be made to open.

I think this is a good arrangement for effect as well as for protection.  It will allow the little columns to be seen from the inside and will make the windows much prettier.

I have selected three of the slate samples you sent.  If you like them we can go right ahead with them.  If you think the red is too strong a contrast, we can leave it out, but I thought little of it would not hurt.

A great many very fine things will be arriving for the ranch-- some of them have already arrived.

They are for the most part of a much higher grade than we have had heretofore.  In fact, I have decided to buy only the finest things for the ranch from now on, and we will probably weed out some of our less desirable articles.

I had no idea when we began to build the ranch that I would be here so much or that the construction itself would be so important.  Under the present circumstances, I see no reason why the ranch should not be a museum of the best things that I can secure.

It will be necessary to give these things very careful attention, and I think somebody should be engaged who knows about fine things and knows how to treat fine furniture, oiling it and waxing it, and keeping it in good condition, etc. These very good things are worth attention and must have it in order to keep well preserved.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
