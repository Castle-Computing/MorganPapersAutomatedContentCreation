[Letter]

September 2, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This is the text of the cable in regard to the bells --

"37 BELLS DELIVERED SAN FRANCISCO 18600 DOLLARS ELECTRIC ORGAN AND KEYBOARD INSTALLED 6850 DOLLARS CUSTOMS DUTIES NOT INCLUDED MICHIELS BELGIUM".

According to the code arranged this would mean that the proposed tower space would be acceptable.

Yours very truly,
