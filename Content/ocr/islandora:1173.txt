C AS YOU SUGGEST FOR HOUSE B THE TERRACE WILL BE LESS CHARMING IN ITS SETTING BUT MUCH MORE ESSENTIAL AS A MOTIF AS THIS IS THE ONLY HOUSE SEEN CLOSELY AS A WHOLE ON SIDE AND VIEW FACE  LOWER CORNER OF HOUSE B FITS IN FINELY BUT AS I WROTE BEFORE THE SUDDEN BARRENNESS OF THE HILLSIDE TOWARD THE DRIVE NEEDS THE SOFTENING CARRYING OUT YOUR SUGGESTIONS WILL GIVE I AM ENCLOSING INTERIOR STUDYS OF HOUSE A
