Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.  Thank you for duplicate Byne check which I gave the American Bank today.

2.  I like your idea very much of having a consulting specialist on the Farm Buildings.  Studying up last winter there seemed to be a good deal of difference in practice depending on climatic conditions.  Perhaps you could get some one familiar with this field.

3.  I have mailed you the electrolier drawings with Mr. Miletin's figures noted in the corners.  It may be you could get them at a better price abroad.

4.  Mr. Maybeck will be up with me for Sunday, unless you send word you prefer another day.

5.  Will bring the balance of the rescued drawings with me.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
