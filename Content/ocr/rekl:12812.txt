April 15, 1923.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Am sending today a new rear elevation of the Main Building showing rear decks and bed rooms three steps above the main second story level.  In going over the revised plans with you, Mr. Joy did not notice that the main rear walls, extended, brought their load down in the middle bed room windows of the mezzanine.  The necessity, structurally, of columns at these points reduces the windows.  Do you think this will be acceptable?

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
