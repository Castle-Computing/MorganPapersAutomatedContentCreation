Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I have happened indirectly upon such queer stories of damage, waste, mismanagement, etc., on the hill that I am wondering if they have reached you, and am enclosing a part of today's report from Mr. Rossie which illustrates, as I know the conditions the reports do not worry me, although naturally I do not appreciate them.

Enclosed is a cutting I thought might amuse you.

Yours very truly,

Encl.
