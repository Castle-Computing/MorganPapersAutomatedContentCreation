Dear Mr. Hearst:

The antique bookcase has very crude working doors, drawers, shelving, etc., which give it a certain "ensemble" character.  We can, as telegraphed, either make the new work in all respects a copy, or can merely copy the design, reasonable "antiqued" on the exterior, and make modern drawers on guides, tight fitting doors, true shelving, etc.  The reason I telegraphed was that the carver had sufficient material on hand to begin assemblying and I suddenly realized looking at the fine old case, that one would feel a lack of genuineness in the compromise -- especially if we use the original cases.  The original fronts could be removed and used on new backs.  The material is all very much wormed.

Yours very truly,

s/ Julia Morgan

I think moderately antiqued is the proper plan (next to underlined merely copy the design, reasonably "antiqued" on the exterior, and make modern drawers on guides, tight fitting doors, true shelving, etc.)
