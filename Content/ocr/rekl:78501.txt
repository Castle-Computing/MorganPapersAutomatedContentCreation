(May 30, 1928?)

Dear Miss Morgan;

I wish you would kindly get estimates on pumping machinery, pipe lines etcetera to bring filtered sea water from the beach to the hill.  The sea water is so much better than fresh water and the amount is so unlimited that I think we should have it for all our pools unless the cost is prohibitive.

The first line of pumping machinery could pump salt water for the ranch house and for anything we might put on the point etc.

In fact salt water could be generally used for baths in San Simeon thus saving the fresh water supply.

This first line of machinery should therefore be made ample.  The other two pumping stations could be less important. All these possibilities should be considered in the estimates.

Where shall we put the highest reservoir - on the present reservoir hill?

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
