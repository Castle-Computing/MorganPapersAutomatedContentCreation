Mr. William Randolph Hearst,

New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I am mailing you with this tonight revised studies of your house A.  There are several things I have changed.

On drawing the side elevation there was an unpleasant pocket between the end of the outside stairway and the bathroom projection.  I do not know how it will appeal to you but I very much like the solution.  It ties the building together and is decorative and while it would take some light from the lower hall I believe that hall will be much lighter than we think on account of the reflection from the water.

On the front elevation there are two different windows: one has decorative colonette in the center,  making two distinct windows; and the other has the colonettes at the side, making a single window with a pair of sash. Which would you prefer?

The balustrade on the drawing we have been using in the studies because it was quickly expressed but I have inclosed the real balustrade on a separate slip of tracing paper, I mean by the real one the one we decided on for the main building or using a variation of this.

The new rear elevation I like very much indeed.  It was suggested by Plate 30, "Spanish Architecture of the 16th Century" and seems to me to be both decorative and residential.  I have not put on the drawing the cartouches you suggested over the lower arches my reason being that the columns below are not under the main supports above between the windows and any ornament draws attention to this fact whereas, without calling attention to it, it seems natural and pleasing.

You understand, of course, that the indication of tile in the cornices is simply suggestive of the material as your own tile will be worked into it.

My only objection to a staircase on the interior is that it closes up the little hallway very much, just at the entrance point.  On the other hand, with  colonettes at the corner in place of the newel posts, and interesting balustrade, it could be very decorative.  I will look into your material for motifs for this and perhaps the columns you sent for the front of the house in the old design could be utilized.  We will go on to the interior next, and as it will not hold back the work, you can decide this point later.  

I put two little storerooms for trunks, etc., off the lower big hall, with entrance.

Your very truly,
