Mr. James A. Murray,
New York American,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Murray:

Thank you for the "key" photograph just received--also for the key itself.

From your description of the marking on boxes, etc. our troubles in locating articles of a set are at an end.

A distinctive mark like the arrow or circle common to all boxes of a given car would help greatly in future locating, as we have now in some cases a dozen sets or more of identically numbered boxes.  It would also help greatly if the identifying mark could be on two or more faces of the box, particularly of the heavy ones, as otherwise the number is sure to be on the hidden or downward side of the box.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
