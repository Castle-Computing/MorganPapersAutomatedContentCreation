Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Joy will leave in a  few days with the various Main Building studies.  I regret not to have the pleasure myself of going over them with you.  

There is a problem in placing the pool in the temple garden due to the fact that the slope is much greater than appears.  I had Rossi run lines through this area, and will make the new studies for this.  The idea seems to me a very decorative one.  Would you care to use here the marble shafts with the Roman heads now in the Pleasanton warehouse?

If you have no objection, we can use the little oriental fruit trees, mandarins, nectarines, guavas, etc. in the various new beds down between "C" and "A" on the lower walks.  both Keep and Webb think they will do well there and they would be both ornamental and of easy access.  One grape arbor could e in the sheltered level spot at the foot of the steps toward "C" from the lower walk.  There is a lovely view from this point -- and it is a natural resting place coming from or going to the orange terraces.  These terraces can be built gradually as the men have odd time to spare, as the trees have plenty of space between to allow of such work.

On spring Hill the larger and older trees are being planted in the more favorable spots and hundreds of hardy but smaller ones, 2' to 3' in the less favorable places, on the theory that their small rootlets will require less immediate nourishment and will in time work down into the rock crevices just as the existing natural growth has done.  Also, have seeds of the varieties you wished, which Keep is planting as he goes over the area.

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan
