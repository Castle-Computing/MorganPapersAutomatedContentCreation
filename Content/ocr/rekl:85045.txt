February 17th, 1932

Dear Mr. Hearst:

You kindly suggested the other day that the new Wyntoon Castle accounts could be paid 
off as we go.  This would be a great help, but what we really are concerned about is 
the paying up of old back accounts which have been so long due that they are not regarded 
as important (to us).

As explained the other day, the Christian Science work payments have come in regularly 
each month in cash, which has carried our office comfortably through these difficult
 days, but in two months our share of this work will be done, and we will need to 
 recall our buried funds to carry on.

Part of these funds are tied up in balances on bills covered by vouchers rendered on
 the two Beach houses, on the Wyntoon Gables revamping of 1930, etc., and held in Mr. 
 Sokolow's office since November 1929-1930.

We are unusually behind on our payment to ourselves on the San Simeon vouchers, but
 this can gradually be worked off as the more pressing of old San Simeon accounts are 
 taken care of.

As always,

Yours truly,
