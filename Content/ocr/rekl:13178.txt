Dear Miss Morgan:

I cannot see that the water tank makes any great difference.  It prevents the use of the chimes, which we practically decided not to use anyhow, but it allows the use of some bells, mainly for appearance though possibly somewhat for use.

I suppose the decoration will be practically the same,a nd the general effect almost the same.  I do not think it matters if you are able to see the floor of the tank level through openings in the tower.  Those openings will have bells in them, and the tank floor will not be conspicuous, especially if we want to stain it dark.

The tank is so useful that I think we should have it.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
