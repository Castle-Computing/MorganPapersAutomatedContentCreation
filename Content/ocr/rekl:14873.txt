Dear Miss Morgan:

What do you think of planting Italian cypress around the tennis court, getting the trees as tall as we can possibly buy them to start with and make a terrace on a level with the court to plant them in.

I believe this would give good enough shade and would make a very pretty effect.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
