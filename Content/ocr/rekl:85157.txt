Dear Miss Morgan:

I have an idea which I have outlined to Mr. McClure.  I think it should provide the 
crowning glory of our Hilltop.  It is this:

Instead of having the rotunda east of the patio which we had contemplated, to have a 
great ballroom and banqueting hall, which shall extend from one wing to the other and 
completely enclose the patio.

This room would be 150 feet long and would contain eight great Gothic tapestries, 
four on the east wall and four on the west wall.

These Gothic tapestries are about 26 X 14 feet.  That means that they would occupy 
more than 100 feet of the wall space, and would leave about 50 feet for entrance, and 
a certain space between the tapestries.

Opposite the entrance we could put our big reredos, if that is what they call the 
thing.

The hall should be about the height of the refectory, and should be lighted by windows 
from the top, and we could use the material we were going to use in the cloister to 
make these windows.

Byne is just sending us a great ceiling, something over a hundred feet long, and we 
could piece that out a bit at either end.

I am asking Brummer to get those French flamboyant Gothic fireplaces, one to go at 
either end of the hall.

I think this can be made the grandest hall in America.

The width must depend somewhat on the space available, but I would think that 40 feet 
would be possible and satisfactory.

This structure could contain some of the other features of the rotunda, such as the 
lower vaulted floor, and perhaps at the center something above the great hall to 
give shape and character to the building; but the great hall of course would be the 
dominant feature.

When this hall is not in use as a ballroom or a banqueting hall, it could be used to 
contain some of the important collections in cases in the middle of the room.  
We could also use a lot of armor there.Miss Morgan--2.

The hall would connect on the South with the kitchen wing, so that service could be 
obtained there for the banquets.

On the North it would connect with the theatre and access could be had to the hall 
through the theatre when shelter was required.

The main entrance would be like the rotunda's, and probably an East entrance from 
the esplanade would be similar to what we planned for the rotunda.

That is the scheme!

Isn't is a pippin?

It not only makes a marvelous hall but by enclosing the patio with an important 
structure, it will make the patio more impressive.

Sincerely,

Your assistant architect,
