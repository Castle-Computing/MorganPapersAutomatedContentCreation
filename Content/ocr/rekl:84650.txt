Mr. William Randolph Hearst, 
Los Angeles Examiner, 
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:
	
	Herewith are attached two bills from
Mattoon & Company, Customs brokers, one in the amount
of $212.38, and the other for $4743.74.

	The first is for Customs entry, bond,
toll and duty on the wooden arch centerings from
Montolive. These were the arches used in taking
down the arches and were shipped over for use in reerecting
the arches in their exact form. These arches
being new, Customs authorities claim are dutiable at
33-1/3 per cent. This duty must be paid before the
arches can be warehoused with the monastery stone.

	The second bill is for Customs entry, 
toll, bond, storage and duty on the Carillon from
Belgium. This shipment was place in the Customs
warehouse pending Customs inspection, and the second
months storage will begin on December 4th. These 
charges cover both bells and automatic player. We
have succeeded in getting this shipment entered as
a complete Carillon under the 20 per cent rate,
whereas, as the time of the purchase, the duty was
estimated at 40 per cent. 

	Yours very truly, 
	Julia Morgan
