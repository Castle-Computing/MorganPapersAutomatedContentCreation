Dear Miss Morgan:

                                                          SHEET NO.1
When we plant Garage Hill, we must consider how it will look from our hill.  I think lots of flowering shrubs and some flowering trees are best.  We can stand flowering trees on this hill if planted in right places, -- they will not obscure the view.

The flowering shrubs in foreground and summer flowering acacias back of them against the dark green of the oaks should make fine distant effect, like large flower bed.  We can use some flowering eucalyptus, too.

There is a protected gully below this hill towards our hill where oranges or some delicate trees might be planted.  If the gully is not protected ENOUGH, black walnuts beyond and eucalyptus in front of walnuts could be planted at lower mouth of this gully as a heavy windbreak.

                                                          SHEET NO.2

This is Reservoir Hill, where I want the largest possible groves of conifers, extended away down to the road and the fence, and all around the hill.

It is well to plant redwood in damp places and some sequoia gigantia in the better and flatter land along the fence.  the other conifers should be planted heavily in all bare spots, COVERING THE HILL.

I hope the deer fence ins NOT over on this hill.  I never intended it to go there.

I do not think we should plant eucalyptus and such flowering trees on this hill.  It is too far off to get flowering effects.  We can get fine effects with masses of conifers, and it will be a pleasant forest to ride through.

                                                        SHEET NO. 3

Citrus Hill I suppose means the stretches south and west of the houses and will be covered chiefly with edible citrus fruits.  In fact I think citrus fruits should go where you now have some vineyards marked, if they will grow there.  the grapes could be moved around to the north of the wall and extended as far as the garage.

We can plant windbreaks wherever necessary to protect the citrus fruits, and we can also use some lath protection overhead, but try not to obscure distant views.  Figs, alligator pears, etcetera, can be planted freely in suitable places here and there from Bath House Hill around to Chinese Hill.  These are both pretty and useful trees.
                                                       SHEETS   NOS 4 AND 5. AND 5.

These do not mean anything to me as I do not know what localities are designated by those names.

Anyhow, the general plan of planting along the road is to border the road with drought - resisting, self - sustaining, summer - flowering shrubs with winter berries of various kinds, but in definite color schemes.  I do not want to have to water or care for these shrubs beyond occasional pruning.

Groves of interesting trees should be planted where they will have decorative value in the perspective.  By interesting trees I mean not only the flowering trees but cork oaks and trees of that kind.  Occasionally the road should pass through some such grove.  This makes the road interesting.

                                                              ---------------------
                                                                APPENDIX

A good opportunity for planting is around the trough and on the side hill above the trough.  A definite scheme of broad effects should be laid out for this locality.

The new road will turn here and go away to the East to Telegraph Pole Hill and then turn there and come back to join the old road lower down.  There  may be some little grove planting along this new road when it is made.  Mr. Gillespie has surveyed it.

we might have avenues of walnuts beginning on the crest of the hill above the ranch house and running along that partly level ridge to the fence or even beyond.  What do you think?

                                                               APPENDIX II.

The planting on Bathing House Hill, where the architecture is pronouncedly Moorish, should be somewhat tropical -- flowering shrubs and trees, and oranges, pomegranates, figs, etc. -- and in the enclosure some palms, hibiscus, camellias -- more delicate plants.

Against the south walls we can spread fruits and perhaps train grapes over pergolas on the roofs.

beyond this hill to the east we can plant olive groves as windbreaks and to the south black walnuts, which grow high and strong and offer a tremendous windbreak.  These would be planted far enough away not to cut off the view.  Flowering eucalypti could e used as foreground to the walnuts -- flowering shrubs on top of hill and oranges etcetera in protected places.
                                                               APPENDIX III.

Chinese House Hill -- the hill to the northwest of House C, where we intend to build the Chinese house -- should be planted something like Garage Hill, and something like Bathing House Hill.

It should be considered from the view point of our hill and should be made of flowering shrubs and flowering trees.

I would mass the shrubs, and use a few magnolias and jacarandas here and there, not massed but as individual trees.  I would also use some smaller citrus fruits, mandarin oranges, pomegranates, etc., and some dwarf peaches, as the peach is a Chinese fruit.

We can plant some grapes and train some vines and some fruits over the walls of the Chinese house. Inside the house I would like a pool and water lilies.

Sincerely,
