Dear Mr. Rossi:

The packed windows did well during the early part of the night but later one of them blew open - not being securely locked I imagine, - and the room was deluged with water.

These storms are very hard to defeat.  I wish you would make the various alternations we have planned while I am here.  I would like to see them made and be sure they are right.  I would not like to have another winter at the ranch under present conditions.

W.R.Hearst
