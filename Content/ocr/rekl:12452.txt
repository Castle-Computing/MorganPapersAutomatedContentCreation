NO INFORMATION ABOUT PLANTING HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED TO ENABLE ME TO MAKE DECISIONS I  THINK  PLANTING SHOULD BE CONSIDERED FROM HALF WAY THROUGH TO RESERVOIR HILL AND GROVES OF VARIOUS TREES AND PLANTS SHOULD BE PLANTED ALONG THIS AREA WHERE TREES WILL LOOK PRETTY IN GENERAL LANDSCAPE BUT WILL NOT OBSCURE VIEWS FROM HOUSES OR FROM APPROACHES ALONG ROAD YOU NEED FOR THIS THE COOPERATION OF VERY EXCELLENT LANDSCAPE GARDENER WHO HAS DEALT WITH LARGE AREAS
