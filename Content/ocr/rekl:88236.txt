Dear Miss Morgan:

Please have all the English and American furniture which we are not actually going to 
use at Wyntoon or Hacienda or Beach House, taken out of museums or storage warehouses 
and sent back to Chris.  McGregor and the International Studio Art Company.

I need this intake there to offset some of the German and Spanish things which we are 
taking out.

W. R. H.
