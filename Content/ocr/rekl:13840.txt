Dear Miss Morgan:

I thank you for yours of July 6th and at your request am enclosing list of dwarf plum and cherry trees, you will note I have ordered no apples.

I wrote Van Dusen Nurseries asking what they would have.  I have a list before me now.  So if you will kindly mail this list promptly, we can rely on the order being filled as sent in.

Thanking you,
Respectfully yours,
Nigel Keep.
