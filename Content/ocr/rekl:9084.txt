Dear Miss Morgan:

There was no diagram of the fencing in your letter, but I imagine one is not needed.  The plan of the Spring Valley Water Company as to their fencing, using two parallel barbed wires instead of one, located on either side of the fence, is probably a good one if it has been tried out, and I suggest that we adopt it.

Green fence posts with white tops are sufficiently satisfactory.  The locations of the thermometers seem to me as good as any.  If we had a sixth thermometer, I would put it considerable down the hill where we intend planting the sequoia, or at the big trough about halfway up the road; this merely to find out whether it is warmer or colder at a halfway point between the Coast and the Hill-top.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
