Miss Julia Morgan,
Architect.

Dear Madam:-

Relative to your order for Sutton & Son's seeds for the Hearst Estate.

Said order left San Francisco via fast mail on October the 26th, and the writer holds in his hands an acknowledgement from Messrs.  Sutton & Sons under date of November the 16th, in which they advise us that Messrs.  Hearst's order has been despatched via parcel post, hence some should reach San Francisco any day.

As soon as we are advised by our customs brokers, we will have entry cleared at once, and deliver to you the package in question.

Yours very truly,
s/ Sherman T. Blake
