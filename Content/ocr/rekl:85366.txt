Dear Miss Morgan:

The latest rugs and pottery &c at Milpitas look very well.

Are there any other things we can send them there.

I think the fireplace in the mens rom could be improved in appearance and in practical qualities.

I will try to find something as a suggestion.

We need more sofas and more easy chairs in this living room.  The wooden chairs 
are rather severe.  They have been removed
to the dining room very largely where they look better

The living room could have a dozen upright chairs of comfortable quality and picturesque 

It could also have three more sofas.

One sofas has been removed for the Taylor quartersWe should replace that and order two more of the same kind, -- the big blue green kind.

Dont you think the roofs of these big rooms should be stenciled or stained

The picture on the walls looks actually small.

Sincerely

WR Hearst
