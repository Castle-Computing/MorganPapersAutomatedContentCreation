Dear  Mr. Hearst:

The roof tile from Spain, although over one hundred years old, is not classed as a work of art, and in spite of all arguments the custom officers here have just notified us today through Mattoon & Company that the duty will be $530.40.  Mattoon has paid this under protest - and we will have to reimburse them.

A similar ruling was made recently in New York covering the importation of old roof tile from Cuba for Florida use.  It was held dutiable.

Do you want to carry the matter further?

Yours very truly,
