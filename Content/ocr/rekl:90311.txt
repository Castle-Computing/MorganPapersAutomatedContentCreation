CONFIRMATION AIR MAIL LETTER

June 20, 1937.

Dear Miss Morgan:

	I think you would better conclude the work
at Wyntoon. I do not mean to say stop short on the thirtieth
of the month; but I judge that the servants' chalet will be
finished and the Pinnacles or Cinderella House will be finished,
and that the summer bouse in front of the Gables will be finished;
and I judge also that the Bridge House will be considerably short
of completion, but probably during the month of July you can put
it in such shape that it will be protected from the elements and 
able to go through the winter without damage. In other words, I 
suppose the exterior can be practically finished. 

	Then after that is done, the whole program will have to 
go over until next year. 

	2. I do not know what is being done about the Sleeping Beauty
House,-- probably nothing at present. I suppose a program should
be laid out to finish the interior rooms, leaving the exterior as is. 

	I do not know how much would be involved in such a program, 
which would include doing the carving and decorating during the winter
months and putting everything in place in the spring. I do not want
to run into considerable expense. 

	3. When you get the men's bunkhouse finished at San Simeon, I 
think I will stop all outside work and do nothing but slowly finish
the bedrooms in the theatre wing. 

Sincerely, 

W R Hearst
