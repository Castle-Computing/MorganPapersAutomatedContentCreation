[Letter]

September 4, 1925.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Here is the Rancho Bella Vista which has a portico something on the Georgian type.  Is it just bad architecture, or could we use something of that kind in connection with the lower ranch house? If it is at all permissible, we could do it better than the enclosed and get one of those tall two-story porticos.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
