Dear Mr. Hearst:

At San Simeon yesterday the banks were running water -- the first time they have done so since four winters ago.  The storm was evidently very severe, taking off the larger part of the oak tree leaves, many big limbs and whipping the garden thoroughly. It was a lovely day and the extra moisture should soon over-make up for the damage. The effect on the ranch ranges was wonderful.  It delayed considerably road and pool work - as while men are working, it will be several days yet before the banks are dry enough to put on full crews.

The mantel is up in the refectory and I feel sure you will think the change worth while. Mr. Joy has been staying on the Hill working out the detail of design necessary to bring together the 28 foot high mantel effect, and the physical connections entailed with the new mantel, and the cloister stones.  It is very hopeful.

You will remember we have not the two twenty four foot tapestries for the Refectory side walls, or the four fourteen foot tapestries for the Hall, out here yet.

I have been following your advise as to concentrating, and am working on the items agreed on to the full and overrunning of the budget.

Yours very truly,
