Dear Mr. Hearst:

I cabled Arthur Byne as to rooms, also as to reja purchase again, -- also Mr. Mechin to push shipment of carillon if not on way, and in any case to report on.

As regards the proposed 'baggage' or service 'double-deck' elevator car -- The Otis people report that their use is prohibited by law in public or commercial buildings, - indicating their danger, - but that nothing in the law covers their use in a private dwelling.  The baggage cage only would operate to the basement, which would be satisfactory, I imagine, but there is still a question as to whether the baggage cage could operate at the Gothic Suite level, due to the drawing in in width of the tower outlines.  (I will have the answer on this point tomorrow).  Their chief objection is, that the new self-leveling devices will not operate with the double cage.  Some new method would have to be devised, and would be expensive.

Yours very truly,
