Mr. William R. Hearst.
New York City

Dear Mr. Hearst:-

Everything is going along nicely.  We finished the pouring of concrete for the 'C' terrace, it looks spacious and nice. The pome-granate trees are being taken out so we may proceed with the rest of the wall.  We have already poured some of the walls of the Servants wing and are going right along. 

By Miss Morgan's order practically all the stone cutters and setters were laid off yesterday.

Yesterday we were visited by some of Mrs. Hearst's friends.  Herewith please find copy of letters I received from Mr. George Hearst.  In connection therewith an unpleasant incident happened.  There was no one of the household on the Hill; Acton gone, the butler gone and the housekeeper gone; these people were about to come and the doors were all locked.  I thought Bohn could open up so I sent for him, it was ten A.M. and he was no where to be found, finally he was located and in a rough policeman's way asked me what the trouble was.  I told him there was no trouble but as some guests were about to arrive I wanted him to open up the doors of the Big Building, wait for the guests as probably I would want him to show them around.  'That sounds like an order' he remonstrated, it is an order I answered; well he answered 'You will have to show them around yourself as I DO NOT TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU'...A lot more followed which was very unpleasant but the above will show you the attitude.

Mr. Hearst this is all very petty, and I hate to bother you with it...But why cant these people try to work together?....Instead of all trying to be independent.  Bohm says his orders are 'not to take orders from me'... and I would like to have your confirmation so that I may act accordingly.  Now Mr. Hearst do you not think that if your Superintendent is not trustworthy he should be let out; but if he is trustworthy and above suspicion the watchmen should work with him?...Mr. Baldwing is the only watchman you have, the others are a joke, they do just as they please, come, go, stay in San Luis, bring their wives up to help them watch etc. etc.

You have told me several times that you wanted me in charge of the 'Activities on the Hill' so if the watchmen are to be independent I want to know it from you.  Please pardon this petty stuff, but while it is petty, it means a lot for the discipline on the hill.

Thanking you for an early reply, I am

Yours very sincerely,
