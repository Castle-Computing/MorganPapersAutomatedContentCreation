October 3rd, 1922.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I am enclosing what seems to be a pretty little plan for vegetable gardens flanking a central flower garden.  Thought this might offer an idea for the hill farm-house.  I do not lay any stress upon the house which is apparently in the Colonial style while we would want an early California adobe.

The location of the horse and cow barns in this case, I would suppose, be well back of the house, possibly with the back yard of the house running down between the horse and cow barns, and containing some fruit trees and such that would partially obscure the barns.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
