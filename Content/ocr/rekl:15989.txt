Dear Miss Morgan:
How about a maze in connection with the zoo. I think getting lost in the maze and coming unexpectedly upon lions, tiger,s pumas, panthers, wild cats, monkeys, mackaws and cockatoos, etc. etc., would be a thrill for the most blase.
If the space is big enough - and will make it bug enough by cutting off more hiss if necessary - we could have a great maze with all these "animiles" and birds and with a pretty pool in the middle, with cranes and flamingos, etc., and a fountain and EVERYTHING.
Lets do this. I think it is a novel idea. If it should not prove practical we can make a maze in connection wit the big pools on Chinese Hill, - but I kind of like the animal maze.
Sincerely yours,
