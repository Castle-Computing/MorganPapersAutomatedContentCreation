Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your telegram, asking me to take up the subject of gardeners last Sunday, must have 
come here after I left Saturday evening.

The garden work was simply carried on waiting your return, with no idea of its being 
more than an expedient.  I did think perhaps that Mr. Resing, who has been head 
gardener in good positions, might make a good man as the plants are in better health 
than in two years past under his care. I did not know your planting scheme, and so, 
unfortunately, he has had no instructions as to color schemes, etc., to carry out.

Besides Mr. Macklen and Mr. Chatfield both anxious to come back - (whose letters I 
do not enclose,) there seemed possibilities in the three applications enclosed, - 
No. 1 as head gardener of the Macklen type; No. 2 , one of an executive type, in 
remembrance of a suggestion of yours last summer that perhaps a man who was strong 
as a manger, working with Miss Worn, might be a solution of the problem; No. 3 a man 
who worked on a place I know quite well.

This information should have been sent to you earlier in the week.

Yours very truly,
