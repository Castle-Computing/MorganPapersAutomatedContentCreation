March 15, 1927.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
A copy of the enclosed drawings for the "Tennis-Gymansium" building went to Mr. Rossi tonight. The depth and extent of the gymnasium excavation in relation to present court and esplanade levels was all discussed and checked with him and the immediate work to be done right away was settled. On Sundays visit the Patio drawings are not ready. Enough struc-tural and other drawings will be ready to go ahead on by the end of this week.
I will be in Los Angeles Saturday and if you do not go to San Simeon could bring you new wall studies for the gymnasium facade.
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
