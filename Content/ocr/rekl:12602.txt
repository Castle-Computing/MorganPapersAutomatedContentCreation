Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive.
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

While standing down at the point (A) yesterday and looking up, imagining the towers, the fine "looming-up" effect grew on me, -- and the regret that few would see it often from this point, or any point giving sufficient near perspective.  then it occurred, why not make the guests' machines stop and descend at a widened space in the road and continue the present steps on down.  the machines could go on around the kitchen turn -- and a strikingly noble and "saisissant" effect would be impressed upon everyone on arrival.  -- The crown vistas down the lower "C" terrace and at the present road level are also elements.  The sketch is not worked out in detail, just the suggestion offered.

[note]
Heartily approve these steps.  I certainly want that "saississant" effect.  I don't know what it is but I think we ought to have at least one such on the premises.  I think these steps are an excellent idea na will be a great addition.  I think we should have a similar flight on the south side down to the Moorish bathing house.

[Letter]
It was a lovely day, and although the north pavements were solid ice sheets, little damage was done to the planting, the most serious being to the more delicate growth in the main terrace garden.  Perhaps a hedging about three feet high to replace the sweetpea iron frame would prevent this in the future.  It should be of golden privet, which is quick growing and hardy, giant box or eunonymus.

[note]
I am afraid a thick hedge would cut off too much view I think the best plan would be to plant hardier shrubs in the exposed place and plant the tenderer thing sin more protected places.

[Letter]

As to the Main Building, if you will not be out soon, would you like me to send the exterior and interior drawings on to you with Mr. Joy?  There are a good many alternate studys in detail collected these past months.  They are working as well as study drawing and have been so expensive it would be worth sending them personally conducted so as to keep in printable form.  Then Mr. Joy could bring back your selections and wishes.  You said to hold off their discussions until you came out -- as lack of such minor decisions would not interfere with the rough construction.  This has been and is true, but if the work is to be rushed without regard to spacing expenses over any special period, it will be necessary to be sure of all these small pints you alone can decide.  In general no changes have been made, nor is there any lack of decision on main ideas.  We do not need the details 

[note]
I Would be glad to have Mr. Joy come on.  It isn't so much that the work is to be rushed as that it should proceed without interruption or unnecessary delay and changes.  I want to save money by having the men always at work on plans that have been prepared in detail and with material that is on hand etcetera.  I think a little more thorough system will get speedier results without any increased expense.
of the main room ceiling - the size of the "Aurora" painting, the Refectory windows, the size of the bases of the Giant de Bologna statues -- also if you have any special place in mind for the Venetian window recently received.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
