Dear Mr. Hearst,-

It would be less expensive for you to have Mr. Byne ship goods for San Simeon delivery 
to San Francisco than to enter them through Los Angeles as there is no regular steamer 
service out of the port of Los Angeles and if service was established the freight rates 
from the port of Los Angeles to San Simeon, we are told, would be much higher than from 
San Francisco to San Simeon; then again, there is a wharfage and handling charge in 
addition to a pick-up charge at the Los Angeles harbor of $2.00 per ton, which charge 
is not made at San Francisco.

You asked me visit before last as to this, and while I had reasons to think so, had 
never made a real check up on it.

As always

Yours truly,

cc La Cuesta Encantada
