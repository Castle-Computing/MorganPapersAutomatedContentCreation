137 RIVERSIDE DRIVE  NEW YORK NY

HAZZARD SAID YESTERDAY HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE WITH NILES COMPANY ACCOUNT NURSERY DELIVERING TREES IN TOO LARGE QUANTITYS TO HANDLE AND WITHOUT PREVIOUSLY ARRANGED FOR NOTICE.  PROBABLY TRUE AS PERSONALLY KNOW FIRST SHIPMENT ARRIVED SAN LUIS OBISPO UNEXPECTEDLY AT TIME HAULING IMPOSSIBLE.  THINK WIRE FROM YOU TO NILES SAYING DELIVERYS ARE TO BE MADE ONLY WHEN AND AS ORDERED BY HAZZARD WOULD COVER DIFFICULTY. THINK HAZZARD LET TEMPER GET BEST OF HIM. 
CHANGE OUT OF MERCHANTS EXCHANGE ?.
