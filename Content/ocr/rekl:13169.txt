September 26, 1923.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

These are the revised structural drawings for the main building towers showing new floor slab and the provision for the water tanks.  This does away with the carillon bell arrangement as planned -- allowing only for the bells in the arches and possibly a few small ones inside.

You will see the underside of the new water tank floor and its supporting beams through the arches.  This is just to be sure you know how it looks.  If you should wish the tanks omitted, kindly wire as Mr. ROssi is making the carpentry forms.

Yours  very truly,

Julia Morgan
