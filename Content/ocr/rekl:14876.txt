Dear Mr. Hearst:

Would you be willing to trade in the old Jackson truck for a new Federal dump?  It can be paid for out of the allowance at say $500.00 a month over a period of six months.  The truck has reached a stage in life where repairs and parts are out of all proportion to its service.  If this is done, what would you think of devoting it to hauling enough rock to wheel track the worst stretched on the Hill road before winter?  I went up last Sunday after only half inch of rain Saturday, and the road was hardly negotiable - so slick and skiddy.  It only takes a little rain to put it in bad shape and an equally small amount of sunshine to dry it up.  The "wheel tracks" need only be a couple of feet wide.

The grading to do at the warehouse site is considerable yet - as soon as the warehouse is up I will follow your telegram's instructions and move up all the material it will hold giving preference to the ceilings, mantels, etc. we will be needing before spring.

Yours very truly,
