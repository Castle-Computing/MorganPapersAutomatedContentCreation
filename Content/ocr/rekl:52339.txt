December 6, 1927.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday's weather on the hill was beautiful - after a heavy wind storm.  The road is practically done, that is, rocked, so that travel should be less hair raising this winter.  It has taken the greater part of the labor this last month.  The steam shovel and men are back on work on the Grande Place and clearing the last of the forrest out of the swimming pool area, and Mr. Rossi promises to push this work.  The service wing is going steadily ahead and already masses up well from a distance.

The redwoods for the shelters were finally located in the Santa Cruz mountains and we expect the first lot of logs and slabs to be shipped soon.

The oak tree on the plaza is being undermined -- so far no tap root encountered.  The place certainly looks upheaved!

The house telephone contractors are well along with their work, but still much to do - and the transformers are ordered and will be up and in by Christmas -- as will be the heaters in all the places you designated.  Everyone is hoping you will surely be there.

Mr. Keep has planted almost all his pines, redwoods, etcetera, and is south personally picking up the erica, etcetera.

Mr. Slattery is liked and seems also to be able to hold his own.

There is a lot to be done!

With kindest regards

Yours very truly,
