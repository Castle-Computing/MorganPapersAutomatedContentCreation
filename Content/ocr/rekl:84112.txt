Dear Mr. Hearst:

At San Simeon yesterday checking up, find the electricians have two weeks work more 
to bring the new layout centering in the Filter Room of the Roman Pool building into use.

The tree people are working along with a small force, Mr. Rossi has men cleaning up 
the form lumber from the new wing, and Mr. Gyorgy and one man are finishing the doors 
in the new dressing room sections.

The mosaic people are finishing packing up the sheets and will go down with the truck 
this week.

The above work, the warehouses, and the camp are operating without funds - so that I 
have not put more people like plasterers, carpenters, etc., on.  Theoretically we 
would have little camp expense to carry at this time, but actually, as only Mr. 
Parks has refunded for camp meals for a long time past, food bills which we count on 
paying through the refunds are much behind.

We have arranged to pay on installments on the various lumber, steel, cement, pergola 
columns, plumbing, etc., bills, but would appreciate as much help as possible this 
month and next.

Yours very truly,
