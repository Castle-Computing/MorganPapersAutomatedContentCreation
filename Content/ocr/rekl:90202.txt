Miss Julia Morgan,

San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan:

	You will recall that last Spring I perfected 
a protest against the Collector's assessment of duty on about 
ten articles of wooden furniture, brought in by Matton & 
Company for the account of Mr. Hearst.

	The furniture constituted the interior of a 
16th Century Aragonese Castle. The main articles in dispute were 
two chairs which we contended were artistic antiques, manufactured 
prior to 1830. 

	I used Doctor Walter Heil, Director of the Palace 
of Fine Arts and his assistant, Doctor Moses, as my expert 
witnesses. 

	I am just in receipt of a copy of the Decision of 
the United States Customs Court, which I enclose, and from which 
you will see that the Court has upheld our protest as to the 
two chairs - the main items in question. The Appraiser had ruled 
them out entirely as reproductions and assessed the duty on the 
theory they were neither antiques, nor manufactured prior to 
1830. As to the other articles, on which our protest was 
disallowed, the question was not one of whether or not they were 
antiques. The Government conceded they were antique pieces, but 
assessed duty on the modern repairs. I do not think that the 
degree of repairs as to any of the pieces represents a substantial
part of the entire article, but the Court has ruled that even 
five percent is substantial and that is what must prevail. 

	The total Jury imposed on the articles within our 
protest was $264.00. That represented by the 40% levy on the two 
chairs, valued at 2,000 pesatas at .1374, which we save, is 
$109.84.

	It is the first of these protests we have won, even 
in part. The difficulty is that the burden of proof is upon ourFebruary 1, 1937

shoulders as protestants. 

	We are short handed at present, and so I would 
appreciate it if you would have the decision copied and return 
to me the enclosed copy and one other copy. 

	Sincerely yours, 
	John D. Costello
