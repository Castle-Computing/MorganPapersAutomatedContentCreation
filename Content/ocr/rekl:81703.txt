Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Rossi disclaims responsibility for pool.  Somebody should be responsible.  I 
doubt if Mr. Slattery can be.  He has too many things now.  Mr. Rossi suggest a 
"maintenance man" and proposes Eubank.

He would take charge of operation and upkeep of mechanism already installed.  What do 
you think?

2.  Things are too loose here.  New and laxer rules have been made and they are not 
adhered to.  Gardners go off at twelve Saturday and some went at nine this Saturday.  
I think we need some new brooms.

3.  I do not think young Sebastian is the man to run the garden.  Nobody pays any 
attention to him and besides he is also one of the first to get away.

I think Heaton is much better and should be given authority, at least until we get 
another man.

When we get another man I think the full day Saturday should be restored.  The idea 
has been that they work longer hours weekdays and take Saturday afternoon off.

I do not think that they work any longer weekdays.  However, we can discuss that matter
 and make a ruling which should be adhered to.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
