Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan:

	I enclose a copy of a self-explanatory letter, dated
July fifth, addressed to Mr. Neylan by Mr. Hearst.
	
	Mr. Neylan wrote to Mr. Hearst recently, asking if he
knew anyone, a resident of San Francisco. qualified as an 
art expert who had visited San Simeon and seen the lamps. Our
thought was that we will need such testimony to augment the
depositions of Messrs. Romanelli and Passini.

	Can you suggesnt the person in San Francisco properly
qualified, who can testify after visiting San Simeon?
Would you say Joseph Mora would qualify or would we need a 
man such as, possibly, Alfred Gump?

	I will appreciate hearing from you.
	
	Sincerely yours,
	
	John D. Costello
