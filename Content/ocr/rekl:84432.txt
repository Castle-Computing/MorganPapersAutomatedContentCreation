Dear Miss Morgan:

It will not be possible to get panelling ready for the assembly rom in the next few weeks, so let us hang the assembly room in damask.

I think I have a nice lot of damask at French's with enough yardage to cover all the wall space in the room that is not occupied by tapestries, stalls and pictures.

As a matter of fact, I think this damask, which is about the shade of the sofas, will be so good looking in the room that we will not want anything else there.

So we need not make the panelling at all, which will save a lot of money.

The walls hung with a rose damask ought to look wonderfully well both with the tapestries and with the dark stalls.

I feel sure that this decorative scheme is going to be a big success.

I do not know whether French has sent out all the damask that we have, so I have telegraphed to McGregor to send any that may be in the East by express.  It should arrive by the time that I get to the ranch, which will be about a week from now.  Perhaps you can come down at that time?

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
