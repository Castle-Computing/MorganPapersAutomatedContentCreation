December 7, 1920.

Note enclosed letter from Mr. O'Reilly with list of contents of fifth carload

Dear Mr. Bogart:

When this car arrives, please have everything put in very safe and careful storage in some San Francisco warehouse, and have Miss Morgan pick out what is required for San Simeon and have those good forwarded as she needs them there.

The other good can stay in the warehouse until the San Simeon building is completed and then be sent to the Hacienda.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
