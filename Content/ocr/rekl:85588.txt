September 23, 1932.

Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I would be glad to try the housekeeper who was at San Luis Obispo provided we are reasonably
 sure that she would succeed.  I would not want to take her away from a job otherwise.

2.  I do not know about the salary for the new housekeeper.  She should certainly not receive
 more than Mrs. O'Brien receives.

3.  I would want to be liberal in notice to Mrs. O'Brien; that is to say I would be willing to
 pay her for three months.

4.  I think the new housekeeper should go over the accounts with Mr. Sokolow.

5.  I would not want Signa Erickson back.  She was very ill natured to everybody and I was glad
 to get rid of her.

6.  I do not think the uniform is necessary.

7.  I will interview the woman from Hollywood and let you know the situation there before you
 speak again to the San Luis Obispo woman.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
