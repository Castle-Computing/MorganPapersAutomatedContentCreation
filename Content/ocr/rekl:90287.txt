COPY FOR MISS MORGAN

May 23, 1937.

MEMORANDUM FOR ALBERT --

	Mr. Hearst has instructed Mr. Apperson to have
all beef government inspected and scientifically tested
hereafter before being sent up to Hilltop. 

	That will obviate the danger of any bad meet 
being sent up. 

	THE NEXT THING IS TO BE SURE THAT IS IS PROPERLY
	TAKEN CARE OF WHEN IT GETS HERE. 
	
	
	To that end, Chief wishes you to take up with Miss 
Morgan the proposition of putting in a newer up-to-date 
refrigeration plant. 

	"THERE SHOULD BE FIRST-CLASS REFRIGERATING 
	EQUIPMENT HERE," he says, "LET US SEE
	THAT WE GET IT, AND ANY DANGER OF TAINTED
	FOOD FROM THAT SOURCE WILL BE ELIMINATED."
	
	Please take up this matter without delay with Miss 
Morgan, to whom I am sending copy of this letter. 

Sincerely

J. WILLICOMBE
