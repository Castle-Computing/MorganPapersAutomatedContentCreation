Dear Miss Morgan:

Here is an article on the amateur stage which may be of some value to you in laying out our little theatre.

The Princeton Theatre stage is only 16 by 19.

We have fully that much I should think.  Anyhow the pictures and article show how much can be done with a comparatively small space.

2.  It was a great shock to hear of the murder on the ranch committed by one of the men in the employment of the Hill.

I sent a telegram about this situation to you and Richard Clark.

It has been evident for a long time that no sufficient care is exercised in employing men on the Hill.  As a matter of fact, no care is exercised at all.

I hardly expected such a terrible thing as a murder but I did expect theft and other minor crimes.

I said in the telegram what I thought was absolutely necessary hereafter, and I certainly will be content with nothing less.

We must positively trace a man's record back for a year and have a written report, sufficiently detailed and accurate, contained in a file, which file should be duplicated in your office, or in Mr. Clark's.

As I said, a special effort should be made to find a man's criminal record.  I wish we could get the photographs of the men as well as the report on their former employment and pursuits.

Perhaps this would be difficult to obtain on account of its resemblance to a Rogues' Gallery, but we should certainly have a record sufficiently detailed to take the place of the photographs.

I am not willing to employ men on any other basis.  If we cannot get this record sufficiently detailed for a while, I am willing to lay off until we do get it.

It is suggested to me that if we insisted on each man having an identification card enabling him to pass the gate-keepers and watchmen, that card could carry his photograph just as a passport carries a photograph or as an identification card in the army carries a photograph.  This

would indirectly give us the photographs required for the record.

At any rate, it may be that we are not altogether to blame for the crime that has occurred, but we certainly will be to blame if we do not take the necessary steps to prevent any recurrence.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
