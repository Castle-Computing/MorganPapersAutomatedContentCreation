Dear Miss Morgan:

I expect, if the weather is fine, to leave here Monday night with the Coolidges and be
 on the ranch for the rest of the week.  I hope you can come down sometime while I am 
 there.

You complain in your letter of the good weather.  That apparently is being remedied.  
It is raining here and I understand it is storming like anything on the ranch.

Don't you think, instead of beginning work on the first of March, we might postpone it
 until the first of April?  Mr. Rossi is apparently not in very good shape.  March is 
 likely to be a pretty wet month, with considerable interruption to work.

April, however, is likely to be a fine month and we could begin then safely.

Nevertheless, if there are some minor things you would like to do during March, such as
 completing the north terrace, we could do that.

I do not believe we should begin work on the north wing though until April.

I will bring with me some sketches I have received from Paris for the statuary above 
the pool on the north terrace.  Not much has arrived and what has arrived is afar from 
perfect, but nevertheless we can probably get some ideas from it.

I hope the lamps that Mr. Joy writes about will soon arrive and I see no objection to 
paying Mr. Freter $1400 immediately,

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
