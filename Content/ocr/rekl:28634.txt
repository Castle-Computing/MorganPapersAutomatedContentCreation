Dear Miss Morgan:

I think this would be useful in the Gothic parlor of the Gothic suite.  If you agree with me, will you please send the following cable to Miss Head:

'Kindly buy linenfold panelling mentioned in letter August 30th for approximately eight hundred pounds.'

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
