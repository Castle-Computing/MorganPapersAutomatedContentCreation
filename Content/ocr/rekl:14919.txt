Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Joy will be very happy to come down and will call you up on his arrival Saturday morning.

Enclosed is a letter form Mr. Byne  I found on my return.  Perhaps this is involving more expense than warranted.

Before moving the old chicken houses I took Mr. Rossi down and talked the matter over with Mr. Parks who said he was not in a position nor had he the men to do the work.  So, as I reported to you, I had Mr. Rossi send down the necessary equipment and do it.  To avoid misunderstanding now that all is kindly, would it be too much trouble to let Mr. Parks know that the chicken houses are to go ahead?  The grading and re-routing of the stream ditch could be done either by Mr. Parks' men and teams, or the teams from above could be brought down as you think best.

Yours very truly,
