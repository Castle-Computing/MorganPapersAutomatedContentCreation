November 7, 1927.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is one set of the reproduced photographs of the lovely Gothic collection, the original photographs of which you looked over at San Simeon.  Three sets of duplicates have been sent Mr. McGregor with the list of the articles you said we might have included in the next shipment forwarded.

Yours very truly,
