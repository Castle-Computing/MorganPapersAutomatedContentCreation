HEAVY BUT COULD BE CUT DOWN TO MAKE THEM AS LIGHT AS POSSIBLE I MEAN CUT OFF THE BACK THAT GOES INTO WALL AND ONLY LEAVE IMPORTANT PARTS THAT ACTUALLY SHOW THE MANTEL MADE IN THIS WAY WOULD NOT BE ESPECIALLY HEAVY AND WOULD BE SUITABLE FOR THE ROOM I THINK AT LEAST I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANYTHING MORE SUITABLE.
