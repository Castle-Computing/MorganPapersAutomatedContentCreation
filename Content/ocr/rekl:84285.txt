Dear Miss Morgan:

It is all right to give the set of dining room furniture to the Taylors.  I do not 
think it is too good.  I do not know where else it could be used.

2. I think the many trunks of Indian material should be shipped to San Simeon, to 
go into one of the new store rooms, so that we can have all of that Indian stuff 
in one place.

I imagine the pictures and the china and glass and all that kind of thing should also
 go there.

I do not see any use paying storage on matter that we can store in our own rooms.

Sincerely,

W.R. Hearst
