Dear Miss Morgan:

A slight change was made in Pancho's house in order to give him a dining room.

2.  While looking over the plans of the houses at San Simeon, as you advised, it 
occurred to me that the warehouses can be treated as a group and made an attractive 
feature

I think the best way to treat them would be to make the new warehouse only one story 
high, the existing warehouse when built two stories high with tower, and the tin 
warehouses when reconstructed, one story each.

This group of four warehouses offers possibilities which I think should be developed.

It would be impossible to have them all two stories high, I think, because the warehouse
 group would entirely dominate the town.

I have asked Mr. Lovell to make some sketches carrying out this idea, and perhaps you
 would like to make some in San Francisco.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
