Dear Miss Morgan:

I do not know whether I ever really expressed myself sufficiently definitely about the gardener at the ranch.

I am very much disappointed in his work.  I do not know exactly to what his failure is due.  It maybe lack of competent help, but I am afraid it is more a lack of conception, plan and character of gardening.

Mr. Webb was allowed to go because he adhered too much to his own ideas and was not very amenable to instructions, but nevertheless, his ideas in the main were pretty good, and his plans and his color schemes were agreeable.

The present man has no plan that I can see. The garden has deteriorated since Mr. Webb left.  It has a neglected look--not that it is neglected--it is cared for in many respects as well as ever, but it is not cared for along the lines that seem to bring any results.

Now, the question is what to do!  I have talked with this man a number of times.
He carries out certain instructions perfectly--well, like clearing small courts of the houses of plans that are too large--but where he is left to do anything himself, such as making effective herbacious borders, he seems to fall down completely.

I think in these matters you can only judge by results--and the results are not satisfactory.

I would advise giving this man some good assistants, and an appropriation, and considerable independence of Mr. Rossi, so that we can see what he is capable of doing under favorable circumstances; and if he is not capable of doing any better than he has been doing, I would advise letting him go.

I suggest this because I think Mr. Rossi (with the best intentions in the world) is rather domineering or dominating, let us put it that way.  He rather tends to keep people in subjection and prevents them from developing any of their own ideas instead of encouraging them to do so.

I think if we would give the man a fair chance, we should give him a little more independence;  and I say this without believing that anything very satisfactory will result from this independence.  If, however, we give him a chance and nothing results, we will know we are not making any 
mistake in letting him go.  Therefore, as I say, I advise giving him some competent help--the help of good, trained gardeners--enough independence to carry out his own ideas, if he has them, and then judging him on the results.

In the meanwhile, you might keep an eye out for another gardener in case this man does not succeed.

2.  The memoranda of trees that I left with you in the hope that you would be able to get some of those trees to plant on the ranch:  Will you kindly inquire of the nurseries, and oblige

Sincerely yours,
