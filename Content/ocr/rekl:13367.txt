Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As telegraphed, this is an idea for using your cloisters.  If it appeals to you it would accomplish several things.

1. Make the entrance court or patio more effective because not too large to be grasped as a whole.

2. Solve the problem of grades in connection with the oaks.  At present the one farthest to the north is quite a problem.

3. Give opportunity for a little fountain court, on the order of these off the cloisters in so many Spanish and Sicilian courts.

4. The cloisters would be lovely in themselves and in their vistas.

5. They carry the pierces stone Venetian note of the Royal Suite loggia fairly well in scale, although of different periods, detail, etc.

It will be interesting to know whether the idea seems to you worth developing.

Yours very truly
JM-deM

Hand written P.S. please notice the idea for enlarging the base of the main building by throwing the esplanade further out.  The increase in size of building made the base too small by comparison.  It has worried me considerably, but I think this may correct the trouble and offer an ornamental motif at an otherwise uninteresting point.  These notes refer to the areas marked X on the plot plan.

"J.M."
