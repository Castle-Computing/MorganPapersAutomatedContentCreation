San Francisco, California

Dear Mr. Neylan,-

Mr. Hearst has recently received from Italy two shipments of carved marble lamps.  
One of these shipments came via the American Express Company, and the other was 
entered at this port through Mattoon and Company, brokers.

Both of these shipments were manufactured by reputable artists, but the Customs 
appraisers have assessed a 50 percent duty.  American Express Company representative 
tell us that it if their opinion that this shipment should be assessed only a 20 
percent duty.  They, accordingly, paid the additional duty under protest.  We also 
had Mattoon & Company protest the 50 percent duty on the second shipment.

Mr. Hearst has asked us to turn the matter over to you for whatever action you 
consider advisable.  We will be glad to furnish you with whatever information or 
documents you need.

Very truly yours,

Julia Morgan
