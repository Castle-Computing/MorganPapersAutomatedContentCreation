La Cuesta Encantada
San Francisco, Cal.



Dear Mr. Hearst:

May I ask a grand favor?  Next time your plane goes from here to the ranch, may I have 
passage?  I could bring the model along.

The doctors have no objection to air travel as am rested and quite well again, although
 a head dress will have to be a costume note for some time to come.

It will be mighty good to see San Simeon again.

Yours truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
