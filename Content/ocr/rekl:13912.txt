Dear Miss Morgan:

Replying to your letter of the 20th, Mr. Hearst says regarding item 2 -- consulting specialist on farm buildings--
"Please get anyone you think good," -- and regarding item 3 -- electrolier--
"I have a photograph of a good electrolier, too.  Maybe you would like to see it."

Photograph of electrolier enclosed.

Sincerely,
s/J Willicombe

P-S Mr. Hearst told me to tell Mr. Rossi to put the iron doors on the wine vault before he left.  Mr. Hearst is leaving Saturday.  Mr. Rossi says he has been trying to get these doors.  Will you try to get them down here and put up before Mr. Hearst leaves,a s he wants to lock the vault and take the keys with him.  He does not consider the wooden doors any protection against possible thievery.  This is probably the most urgent thing at this moment.  Have wired you to-day on subject.
