OPVRIGHT. :5 i
A BEAUTIFUL BORDER OF FLOWERS IN THE GARDENS OF OUR CUSTOMER, SIR E. S. WILLS, BART., LITTLECOTE.
(Gardener, MR. W. T. SMITH.) Reprodured from a photograph in natural colours.

 

Visitors to the Horticultural Shows will doubtless recall with pleasure the many ﬁne exhibits of
Flowers which we staged in different parts of the country during the past year.

For ﬁve seasons in succession (1923-7) the Gold Medal of the Royal Horticultural Society has been given
for our .unrivalled displays of Cyclamen, while in the past spring two Gold Medals were awarded for our
Cinerarias. Our Gold Medal Salpiglossis at the Chelsea Show in May last, illustrated on page 159, will be
remembered as one of the most beautiful features of the Exhibition, and twice in recent years our Collections
of Annuals and Greenhouse Flowers have been awarded the Cup for the most meritorious of the many
wonderful exhibits at this great Show. Favourite greenhouse subjects raised from seed, such as Begonia,
Calceolaria, Cineraria, Cyclamen, Gloxinia and Primula, have been developed and brought to their high
state of perfection in our glass-houses at Reading, where they produce a brilliant spectacle in their
respective blooming seasons. From November to February these glass-houses are illuminated by electric
light in the evenings, and present a fairy-like scene to travellers on the Great \Vestern Railway.

Our Sweet Peas have secured no fewer than nine Gold Medals in 1927, and a number of similar honours
have also been awarded for Annuals, the magniﬁcent displays of which in our Trial Grounds at Reading and
Slough afford much pleasure to passengers in passing trains.

All the. best varieties for providing a wealth of ﬂowers for beautifying the garden and greenhouse, as well as
for supplying cut material for house decoration, will be found described on pages 87 to 182.

Balsams are excellent for conservatory decoration, and they are also
freely used as border plants and for bedding. Considering the fleshy

Lavatera rosea splendens makes a Splendid ‘hedge’ plant for the ﬂower- garden.

The Lavateras, or Mallows as they are more popularly known in gardens, are extremely showy subjects for tall borders and large beds.
Lavatera, Sutton’s Loveliness, is undoubtedly the finest form of all the Pink Mallows; the imposing ﬂowers are exceedingly rich in colour and
may be cut on stems of 2 feet or more in length. Lavatera alba splendens is similar in all respects save colour, and gives a charming effect
associated with the pink variety. Both are perfectly hardy, but it is important that the seeds should be sown where intended to flower, as transplanting
often fails. The Red Malopc is another excellent form of Mallow, and supplies a fine rich crimson shade that is as yet wanting in the Lavateras.
