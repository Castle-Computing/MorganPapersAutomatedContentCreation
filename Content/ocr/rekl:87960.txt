Dear Mr. Hearst:

In regard to caring for your tapestries.  The Gomes family have a pleasant large work 
room under excellent conditions at their home near Hayward but the district has poor 
fire protection.

It would be safer to have the work done on the Hill, if practical. Would you think 
well of using one of the new end bed rooms above the theatre temporarily as a work 
room, bringing the Gomes to the tapestries?  They are quiet, gentle people and seemed 
to be well liked by the household this summer.  We pay them seventy-five cents an 
hour each and of course provide materials and transportation.

Yours very truly,
