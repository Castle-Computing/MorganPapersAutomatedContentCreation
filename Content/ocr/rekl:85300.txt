Dear Mr. Hearst:

Some years ago the Andrews Hotel in San Luis Obispo was taken over 
by a couple of middle-aged women, who did not succeed in making it 
pay.  One of them is in type for a woman what George Loorz is for a
 man,-(only not as to "voice"), simple, direct and capable - and 
 with a natural manner.  The hotel rooms under her regime were 
 always clean and the service efficient and kindly.  I often thought 
 she would make a good San Simeon housekeeper provided she were 
 versatile enough.  She may have re-located, but fairly recently she 
 called here at the office asking if I knew of any possible opening.  
 Her name is Mrs. Ada Drew, address 187 West 41st St., Los Angeles.

My eye has been on the Hill situation since you drew my attention to 
it some months ago.  Two years ago Mrs. O'Brien would have been the 
first to have greeted the San Luis visitors, and to have taken every 
care of them, and the changed viewpoint is evident in very many 
directions.

As always

Yours truly
