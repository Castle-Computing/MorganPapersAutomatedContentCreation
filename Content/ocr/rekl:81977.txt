Dear Miss Morgan:

My understanding of the division of funds is that altogether the construction on the 
ranch is give $25,000 a month and Mr. Slattery $15,000.

I should think that Mr. Slattery's $15,000 would include a certain amount of minor 
construction which comes under his direction, such as the wall and fences.

Will you kindly let me know how the $25,000 is divided which comes under construction--
 how much goes to Rossi's work on the Hill Top, and how much in other directions.

It does not seem to me that Rossi's work is going ahead very fast, and perhaps we could 
divert some funds from other directions and get more progress in the concrete work.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
