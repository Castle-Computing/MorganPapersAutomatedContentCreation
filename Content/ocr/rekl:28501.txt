Dear Mr. Hearst:

I certainly have been negligent in the matter of the drawings for the marble colonnade.  Usually when analyzed - 'why things are let go' - which could just as well have been done, I find a lack of conviction as to the design.

If I cannot send the draftsmen, will bring the drawings for the colonnade as well as those for the new 'C' terrace on next Sunday's visit, and will bring down and leave a draftsman to make the changes you suggest.

Yours very truly,
