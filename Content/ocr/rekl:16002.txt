Memorandum for Miss Morgan:

First, the tennis court. I am afraid it would be very expensive to lower the plane of the Tennis Court. Moreover I doubt if it would be well to lower it too far below the plane of the Esplanade.

I suggest therefore that we build on to the present tennis court 120 feet wide and about 70 feet in length.  This will give us space for two courts and will also give us opportunity to use about ten feet at the south of the court for seats, with stairs descending on each side.  This could be made quite a decorative feature.

One trouble with the present court is that, being rather a hasty job, it does not correspond in sumptuousness with the rest of the establishment.  We could make a very impressive feature for the south end of the two courts in the way just described.

We should also have seats on the east side of the east court and the west side of the west court opposite the nets.  These are the best viewpoints for the game.

On the north side of the two courts, opposite the south side feature, we can have a house for rackets and nets and balls and other paraphernalia, and this too can be made an attractive feature.

Then of course we will plant the masts 25 feet high the proper distance to give sufficient strength to hold the canopy.

I think the canopy should be green and that the court should be green, and that the lattice between the mats should probably be green,  covered with climbing roses.

I know that you fear the effect of the high north wall of this court, but I should think we could overcome any unpleasant effect there by making a decorative feature, a flight of steps on each side and a fountain in the middle, coming down to the level of the circle in front of the garage.

There is no need of doing anything with the two courts until towards spring, but I would like to have all the designs made and the plan approved, so that the work on the court can be done in my absence and the courts be ready for next season.

2. The other things to be done this winter are the north wing of the patio, the servants' house and the two new houses.

I think we should approach these with the two crews.  In that way, the north wing of the patio can be poured while the servants' house is being poured and when these two things are done the new house on the north of the Esplanade and the new house on the south of the Esplanade can both be poured at the same time, each one having its concrete crew.  I do not know of any other way to get the work done.

I do not know to what extent we can pour concrete in winter, but I should think we could do it pretty successfully, as the rain ought to help rather than hurt the setting of the concrete.

3.  I suppose that this fall will see the library and the Gothic suite and probably the tower rooms finished.  The tower rooms would make wonderful sleeping porches, largely open to the air.  Perhaps they can be put to better use, but at least they will be useful for this.

The new york room which is to be east of the Gothic suite can probably be finished this fall and winter too, and possibly the kitchen and pantry can be completed.  So that the main house will be practically finished except for the decorating and furnishing of the north wing.

I would like to plan out these things so that we will know at what speed we have to advance.

The road building crew, entirely apart from Mr. Rossi's organization, seems to be working well.  They will have the menagerie hill leveled soon and the road north of the hill completed.

The main road to the ranch house will be done by the end of September.  I think that is all the road we need and I will abandon entirely the road which we contemplated building down the canyon.  This would be expensive, costing probably $50,000 or $60,000, and I do not think it would be used much.  I rode over the route on horse back and it is very disappointing. It is in the trees most of the time and the houses are seldom in view.

This route would be good enough for a trail, but very bad for a road.

The money that we would spend on this road I would prefer spending on a dam.  Mr. Rossi has selected a dam site at the foot of the ravine and I am asking him to have the necessary tests of the flat bottom made, to be sure that we can build a dam there, and also to have the specifications made and estimates of the cost accurately made.

Apparently we can build a forty foot dam for about $50,000, or the cost of the road which we have decided not to build.

This dam would hold plenty of water for irrigation and should make a very pretty lake and fish pond.  It would solve Mr. Parks' water problem and to a certain extent relieve the drain on the Hill's water supply.

If our road building crews get through their road work by the latter part of September, they should be able to build the dam and have it completed before the first of the year.  Perhaps the crew that has worked on menagerie hill could be transferred to Chinese hill and take off the top of that hill, and in a way make way for our ambitious plans for the salt water pool.

This is perhaps the finest site any where around here and the question of how best to take advantage of it in the matter of construction is quite important.

I have various vague plans which I would like to discuss with you.  Mr. Hunter has sent you a number of pictures and suggestions for various features.  I am merely trying to lay out here the general plan for the fall and winter work.

Sincerely yours,
