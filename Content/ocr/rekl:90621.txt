Dear Miss Morgan:

As you are more familiar with Mr.Rossi's qualifications, could you fill out the 
enclosed Civil Service blank with the information desired by the Commission.

Of course it is intended for Mr.Hearst to sign.

Personally, I do not see how any one individual could know so much about any other 
human being as would be required to answer these queries.

Also, I wonder if Mr.Rossi has all the qualifications for Senior Engineer indicated.

Mr.Rossi was never  a "shrinking violet" and his application for this position would 
seem to indicate that he has not changed.

Whatever you do about it will be okey with me.

Awaiting your advice,

With best wishes,
s/J Willicombe
