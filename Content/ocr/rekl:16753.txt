February 23, 1927.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst ,
La Cuesta Encantada.
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:
Would it be safe and prudent for me to risk your finding the sitting room of House A minus its red velvet hangings? If so, the old velvet is here you sent in order to finish these hangings in all genuine old velvet, and this done, we could use the material taken out to make the border and linings for the big curtains between the social room and ves-tibule -- or at least it would go quite a way toward doing so.
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
