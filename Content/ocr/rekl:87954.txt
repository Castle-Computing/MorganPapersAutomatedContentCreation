Dear Miss Morgan:

The member of the family is a fine idea, and the lady is apparently just the one you 
should have with you.

If you pardon me for butting in a little bit, I am going to see that you get a 
comfortable cabin on the boat so the trip will really do you some good.

Then when you land, please land at Naples, and I will have our correspondent get a 
nice automobile for you and your relative to take you down to Pompeii and Sorrento 
and Amalfi and to the temples at Paestun; then back to Naples and then up to Rome.

When you have satisfied yourself with Rome, the automobile will take you to Perugia 
and Assisi and Siena and Florence, and via Bologna to Venice.

After you are through with Venice and Padua, the automobile will take you through the 
Dolomites to Bolzano.  And I think the best way to go from there in the winter is to 
Innsbruck over the Brenner,-- it being the lowest pass in the Alps,-- from Innsbruck 
to Pussen to Munich.

From Munich the automobile can take you to Augsburg, Nordlingen, Dinkelsbuhl, 
Rothenberg, Nurmberg, and through Wurzburg to Frankfurt; and then down the Rhine to 
Coblentz and Koln.

From there you can go by automobile through France to Calais or through Belgium to 
Ostend or through Holland to the Hook of Holland.

From any of these ports boats take you to England.

Miss Head will be delighted to see you in London and will take you to the Castle, 
and you can come home on the Europa or the Bremen from Southampton.

I hope you will take the time to make the trip right and not to hurry; and since you 
are going to leave McClure here, I am sure you need not worry about affairs at home.

The automobile is going to be my automobile, as I have some stored in England, and I 
am naturally going to attend to everything in connection with it; and all you have to 
do is just sit in it and be a good girl, which I know is very hard for you to do. 
Please let me try to help make the trip agreeable.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
