Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is a sketch of the change in the front of "A", also an idea of the new elevations.

It was unintelligent not to have put in the hanging strips throughout, instead of only in the sitting rooms.  I did not think of it, but was afraid the wood in the course of time would show the difference in materials.

It does not seems too bad to have to screen those French doors.  Does that include your fine front doors also, or only the openings on the terrace sides?

I will order the materials for the cedar closets in the basement and the other items you speak of.

Yours very truly,
