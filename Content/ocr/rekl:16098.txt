TALKING WITH ROSSI URGING HIM TO HURRY THINGS AT RANCH I FIND HE HAS A LETTER FROM YOU SUGGESTING HE REDUCE FORCES STOP PLEASE DONT ASK HIM TO DO THAT UNTIL ON OR ABOUT MIDDLE DECEMBER WHEN WE ARE ABOUT TO CLOSE FOR HOLIDAYS STOP I THINK WE NEED FULL FORCE WORKING DURING OCTOBER AND NOVEMBER TO CARRY OUT CONSTRUCTION WE HAVE PLANNED STOP THE REDUCTION IN FORCE WOULD NOT SAVE GREAT DEAL MONEY  BUT WOULD SERIOUSLY HANDICAP WORK STOP
IF NECESSARY I WILL SUPPLY ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO COVER THESE EXPENSES

W R HEARST.
