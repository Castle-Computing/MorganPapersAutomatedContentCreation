Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In regard to the Refectory Ceiling:

Do you see the decorations painted directly upon the beams, girders, etc., as in the Sicilian original, -- or have the decorations first modeled in very flat relief?  One reason for suggesting modeling is that paint and gilding do not seem to stand as well on the flat surfaces as on molded or modeled ones.

We still have not received, so far as I can tell, the stone windows for the refectory -- very much needed.

Mr.Van de Loo is back, ready to start on the model for the main cornice.  If you have no objections, the plan is to model a full size section of the frieze with brackets, corbels, etc. -- and try it in place, making in this model any corrections you may think advisable.  The variations in corbels, brackets, etc. to be made directly by the carvers.  By sufficient "standing over" I think results could be had this way.

The orange trees are nearly all in and look very pretty.  I do hope you will like the way the rows are laid out -- the lines run well up toward Lower B Terrace.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
