Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I made a misstatement in the "water line" letter in regard to the experiment with large pipe, 5" and 3", from the reservoir to the camp.

The facts and results are correct as stated, but the pipe used was not "galvanized".  The word slipped in without my being conscious of it until re-reading just now.

We used pipe Mr. Lee gave us taken out of the old Pine Mountain Line, and it was iron pipe.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
