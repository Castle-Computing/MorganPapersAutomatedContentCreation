Dear Miss Morgan:

I am delighted celestial ceiling is progressing so well and so satisfactorily, and 
that Mr. Solon is doing the work he does so ably and artistically, and is not 
interfering with the progress by undertaking executive details.

2.  I imagine from your letter that the rooms Mr. Loorz is now pouring concrete 
stairs and walls for are the rooms over the music room.  That is fine and looks to 
further progress.

I imagine we will need some more ceilings for this north-east development, and perhaps 
we should start Mr. Byne looking for them.

I think we have made all his payments, or will have done so by the end of the month.  
Therefore, we will be in position to undertake new payments for new material.

In fact, I see no reason why Mr. Byne cannot now proceed with the various stone 
ceilings from the other monastery.

3.  I am glad you like the new mantels.  I imagine we are sufficiently supplied with 
mantels for the immediate future.

I am glad to see you have lots more strength and energy after the operation, but I 
do not think you should exercise it all.  Better keep  a big reserve.  So take things 
easy.

I have had quite a lively time myself, but I really have nothing to complain about.  
Everything looks good at present and the best thing on the horizon is the possibility 
of a prompt return to California.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
