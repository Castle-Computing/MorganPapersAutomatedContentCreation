September 5, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed are the prices for the candelabra you asked me to get for you.  Mr. Miletin quoted on two each last year -- $1400 each and $1600 each on two designs, so the reduction "wholesale" is considerable.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
