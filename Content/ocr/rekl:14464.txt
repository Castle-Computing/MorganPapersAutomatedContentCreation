Dear Mr. Hearst:

The cow man, Mr. W.D.Williams, (Route 3, Box 68, Chico, California,) has just returned -- I had a friend there go to see him who reports that Mr. Williams is not well and does not think in his present condition he should be sent to San Simeon.

There is another older man available - a J.M. Charlton - for the last five years at the Millbrae dairy, Mr. Ogden Mills' place, near Burlingame.  He is Irish, about 53 years old, understands the dairy generally, and is especially good bringing up pedigreed calves.  The reason he wants to change is partly ambition and partly that he has to cook his own meals where he is. He would come for $125.00, room and cooked meals.

Yours very truly,
