Dear Miss Morgan:- 

	Thank you for your letter of July 24th, 
just in this morning, and for the copy of the Pacific

us. 

	On its receipt I will take the matter up
with our people here, and if we find that we need 
any further information which you can give us, I will 
not hesitate to come to you. 

	Yours sincerely,
