Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I am guilty of spending too much this year on the gardens and orchard, but not exactly because of not giving Mr. Webb and Mr. Keep sufficient initiative in their fields.

The material bought was chiefly to complete the orchard planting to the extent you have indicated: 2) the planting of the Temple garden area, and from there to well beyond the main cross axe steps: 3) an installment of bank, fruit and foresting planting for Chines hill; 4) carrying on of the bank planting, stopped when the drought became apparent: 5) the filling out of the bank planting along the road west from the new steps: 6) additional planting in the redwood and sequoia flats: 7) an extension of reservoir hill planting: 8) gully and hill planting as transition from the orchards into the natural planting, and individual walnut tree planting on the ranch side of the white gates.  This material has been planted except in the area from the Temple over to the cross axe, when work was stopped owing to the change from lily pond to swimming pool, The material is under the trees in the "acclimation nursery" and can probably be all placed by the middle of June.  some redwoods were bought and evergreens -- a fine lot about 3 1/2 to 4 feet high, -- to try out an experiment of acclimating in the nursery instead of under direct planting -- except for these trees every big of stock bought was for definite use in definite areas -- as worked out by Mr. Keep and Mr. Webb in their respective fields.  Most of the orders were placed last fall, while you were her or soon after, and I had both men on their vacations in the Fall go to the various nurseries and select the individual plants and trees from eh stock available so as to get the shape and habit of plant wanted as well as species and size.

I do not think it will be necessary to spend much from now on for nursery stock except for small individual plants, palms, etc. you personally choose, as the stock ont he hill will be large enough to subdivide and propagate from in another year -- and the addition of one good man as nursery propagator for both garden and orchard, (probably under the direction of the new gardener) would provide for renewals and new stock.

As to methods of ordering, -- the enclosed samples from the files at random of both orders and correspondence will show how the work has been handled.  Straight direct order lists from them, without letters, etc. would certainly save me much time, but both men are os high strung they seem to work better when allowed to express themselves -- and I have willingly provided the ear they have seemed to need.  If you think results would be better handled some other way, I will gladly made whatever changes you suggest.

Mr. Keep has been given all the equipment he has asked for.  The kind of horses he wanted could not be obtained until recently.  He told me on my last visit that the ones finally bought were ideal and that he was entirely satisfied.  He always want more men - but has proportionally his share.

Mr. Webb was given full freedom after you left to have built for him such temporary hot frames and shelters as he wanted.  He would naturally like a permanent location and outfit.  I have not tried to provide them this season, because, while you indicate the general location for them, the while Alhambra development, steps down tot is court, etc. would have to be very definitely laid out to avoid making them just wrong.  thinking that the use of the â€˜Raimondo Ruiz Ceiling" would revolutionize the Alhambra plans made me stop doing much on this section.
I still feel as last year about both Mr. Keep and Mr. Webb -- that Providence provided them and that they could not be better in their lines.  Unfortunately Mr. Webb's wife, who decides for the family, very much dislikes country life and Mr. Webb has objected to having his lily pool planting disturbed.  I certainly will do my very best to keep them. 

I have tried a moving picture show once a week without asking you, which has been well worth the money in keeping down "turn-over". The operator brings him own machine, pays his expenses and shows seven reels for $30.00.  But I must not take your time on camp detail.

Anything you wish me to do or try out in the way of management or of apportioning of expenditures I will gladly endeavor to do.  With so may items to cover on the Hill with much thought given to "schedule" there is plenty of room for errors of judgment.

Sincerely yours,
J M-deM
