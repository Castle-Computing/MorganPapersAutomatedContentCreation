COPY TO MR LOORZ --
AND MR CUTTER.

Aug. 6, 1936.

Dear Miss Morgan:

In addition to the $25,000 a month alloted by Mr. Hearst for construction at San 
Simeon and Wyntoon, you undoubtedly know that $7,500 a month and about $750 a week 
additional is being expended respectively for work that Mr. Loorz is directly 
supervising at San Simeon, and work that Mr. Stolte is supervising at Wyntoon.

MR. HEARST WISHES TO KEEP THE TOTAL EXPENDITURE FOR ALL THIS WORK WITHIN THE 
$25,000 A MONTH ALLOTED TO YOU AS ABOVE.

He would like you to give it general supervision, deciding what is to go ahead and 
what is to be held in abeyance: of course your construction will take precedence.

I have explained this to Mr. Cutter.  He says, and it seems proper, that a few weeks 
of the present arrangement will probably be necessary before cutting down.

Thanking you, and with best wishes,

Sincerely yours,

J WILLICOMBE
