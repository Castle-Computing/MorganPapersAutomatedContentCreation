December 15th, 1921.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As I did not really know, I had the question of treating the ends of the Redwood fence posts looked into as thoroughly as possible, and you may be interested in the attached extracts from the memorandum.

Your sincerely,
