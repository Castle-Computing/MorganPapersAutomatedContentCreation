Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your telegram was received regarding the partial shutting down of the Camp.  I have made arrangements for a new kitchen regime, with a daily limited supply system, and am taking back the first cook we had -- the one who was "used to cooking for the editors", as he was both economical and clean.  We have a new labor foreman to handle and keep an eye out for what one might call the "rough labor", -- to eliminate "letting down" in the groups now often out of sight.  Also a man from the office detailed to look after the basements while the cases, etc. go in and rearrange the objects.

I have not been able so far to find a satisfactory substitute for Washburn, and would like your judgement.  The two best promising men that I have had my eye on for the past months as meeting fairly well requirements, both have families and are unwilling to put up with the housing at San Simeon, and there is  no accommodation at Cambria -- no vacant houses.  We can get good, active, aggressive superintendents who are used to general construction work; but it is difficult to find them also fulfilling the other requirements.  Would you think it best to let Washburn go anyway and trust to the nearest obtainable at this time, or would you keep him on until May?  An answer by telegram would be appreciated.

Would you be willing to have the doors opening onto the lower lobby of "A" of walnut instead of composition?  It seems to me they would carry better with the doors above.  The panels toward the bedrooms would be composition, same design.

Your sincerely,
