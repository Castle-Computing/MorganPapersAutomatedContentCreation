Dear Miss Morgan:-

I have marked on the plans all that I have time to think of.

I think the assembly room should be 85 fr. long instead of 75 ft.  and that this extra length should be used to get the tapestry away from over the doors into the refectory, if that is a desirable thing to do, and I rather think it is 

I do not believe the extra width will be disadvantageous outside.  I am inclined to think that the central gabled roof will be better for being a little wider in proportion to its height.  the extra length of the assembly room will enable you to make your front window wider and probably also enable you to get the east window looking out on the middle terraces, if you like that idea.

2. I like the equal towers because they balance the frame of those middle terraces, and because they enable you to make the refectory longer without the towers interfering with it in any way.

Of course the terminals to those towers can be made any way you think most picturesque - I leave that entirely to you.

I think the gabled roof should be extended longintudinallly back of the rear towers as I have indicated in a black pencil sketch on your drawing.

I think the extra length gives more dignity to the building and  a much better side line.

I believe you will agree with me in this even from the wretched sketch I made to indicate the idea.  This also gives us an upper rear room of some consequence.

I do not think there should be a tile roof above the rear loggia.  I think it should be a flat roof and it should be a sort of a viewbalcony for this upper tier of rooms.

3.  I think the small rear dining-room is very satisfactory, but I do not like the passages leading into the alcove.

I think this spoils the alcove, which would otherwise be a very attractive spot - with window seats, etc.

My idea was to have the doors at either end of this small dining-room - one leading into the open air and the other leading into the passage or into the gun room on one side and the serving pantry on the other side.
I think the passages could come into this gun room and serving pantry.  That would be my idea of the best way to handle the matter, but if it presents architectural difficulties, put the passage any where you like only please not connecting with the alcove.  It might be that the doors which I have marked leading int the open air should lead into the passage - but I think the farther front you can get the passage the more space you will have for your rear court.

4.  I have advised that you put a flue for a fireplace where the sideboard is as we may want two fireplaces instead of a fireplace and a sideboard.

I thin with these modifications the building will be very fine, giving us more than we had in the other sketches and a better looking building in addition.

I am sailing tomorrow.  If you will send to me care of J.Y> McPeake, National Magazine Company, No. 1 Amen Corner, Paternoster Row, London, E.c.4, England, everything that you would ordinarily send here to New York, I will be able to send prompt answers by cable and there will be no great delay.  I would like to have sketches and plans continually as your work develops - that is the next best thing to being on the ground.

Sincerely,
s/MR Hearst

Referring to pictures of doors enclosed - the big doors are in rather bad condition - broken more than indicated in pictures - in numerous places that you can see and in some that you  cannot see.  The smaller door frames are in very good condition.  they are much later, however - nevertheless they are so nearly perfect that I think we could probably use them to advantage in the rear dining room.  There are four of these - absolute matches.

There are two of the big arch door frames.  We might be able to use them in the lobby instead of the big square door frames.  There is a little side fountain of some interest which I will not get unless you have a place for it; also a little garden piece of columns which we might be able to use but which I am rather indifferent about unless you have a place for it.

I found some old lions which may go well in front of house "B" on those bases which were have never been able to fill - I am not sure they will however - 

The photo marked X is purchasable here if you think we want it.  Please advise me promptly.
