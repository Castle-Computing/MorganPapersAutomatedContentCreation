Mr. William Randolph Hearst
Wyntoon
McCloud, California

Dear Mr. Hearst :

	Would you consider taking
some of the big living room furniture from Jolon
to the San Simeon men's house -- say two of the 
four card tables with eight of the sixteen chairs, 
two couches, two big chairs.

	The new bog room would look and 
be habitable then and they are not being used at
Jolon now. 

	As always, 
	
	JM:F
