Dear Miss Morgan:

I judge from Byne's letters that he is rather hopeless of ever getting the Alcantara 
stuff out of Spain.  If he is not, I am, because the revolutionary attitude of the 
people over there would make it dangerous to go contrary to their wishes.

However, I think we should ask Byne to proceed if ever he gets a safe opportunity.

The thing that I am most anxious to get are the vaulted ceilings, both of the 
library and the corridors, that we had hoped to make into a wonderful library 
room for Wyntoon.

I am certainly disappointed not to have this material.  But I think we might as 
well think up some other way of treating Wyntoon.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco, Calif.
