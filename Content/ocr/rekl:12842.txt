May 13, 1923. 

Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst has instructed me to call your special attention to a large number of old lanterns that he has purchased in the last few days at the sale of RAIMONDO RUIZ here for use in San Simeon.

Mr. McGregor will advise you in detail regarding them, in the usual way.

The purpose of this note is stress the fact that they are fragile and require special care, the old glass being irreplaceable if broken.

Mr. Hearst has instructed Mr. McGregor to have special care taken in the packing and marketing of the cases to insure against breakage.  And Mr. Hearst suggests, to this same end, that it might be better to ship these lanterns to you at San Francisco to be stored there by you in a particularly safe place -- unless, of course, you are sure there is a safe place for them at San Simeon where we can feel sure they will not be handled roughly, so to speak.

Will you kindly send me a wire on this point and I will take it up with Mr. McGregor and the lanterns will be sent to San Francisco or to San Simeon as you elect.

Sincerely yours,
s/J Willicombe
