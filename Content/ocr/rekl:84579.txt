Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.  The only silver candlesticks received this summers those reported to you last night 
as being used in the Cloister rooms, the twins' room, and one small pair reserved for 
the deck room.

I think these should be in the refectory

2.  The Roman plunge is taking shape.  Do you still think it best to take out the wide 
pilaster in the main plunge room?  I do not wish to be insistent, but just sure.

I think so.

3.  In regard to the replacement of the San Simeon private telephone poles, do you want 
Mr. Gillespie back?  He does not seem to be on any of your pay rolls at present and 
will need a "heading up" to get the material, use of equipment, etc. needed.  I was 
negligent in not asking yesterday, as some poles need prompt attention.

Yes'm

As always,

Yours very truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
