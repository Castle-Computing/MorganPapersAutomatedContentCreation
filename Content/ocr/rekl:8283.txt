WRH
May I fix up the lower suite A temporarily so that it will be interesting and comfortable using objects intended for main Bldg. Am just returning from San Simeon. Went over Water trouble with Dr. Dawson and think he has real solution [theres?] more water from spring than last week but not enough to run mixer.
