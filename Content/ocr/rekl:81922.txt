April 8, 1929.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Whigham has just written to know if he can have some photographs of exteriors or 
interiors of the Hill for publication, learning that an airplane picture was in 
circulation.  Would you be willing to have some of the last "collection" used?  As 
you know, I have never given any.

Yours very truly,
