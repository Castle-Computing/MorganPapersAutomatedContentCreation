Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive, 
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I. In order to enclose "The Hall", would you consider using the recently received grille of which the photograph is enclosed, enlarged as sketched?  It has the advantage of not cutting off a great deal of light, yet being interesting in itself.  I was surprised to find it so much more os than the photograph suggests, or-

1st

II. Would you use the one originally intended for the entrance on the plaza, -- enlarged as indicated on enclosed sketch M-167.

2nd

III.  The very large circular headed grille I take to be meant for the main doorway and unless you say to the contrary will have it mounted into a frame.

[Margin Notes]
OK

IV.  On the trip last week to the Hill I was delighted with the Royal Suite loggia.  It would make with the sitting room a beautiful summer dining room.

[Margin Notes]
Good.  It will be doubly attractive when the patio and rear entrance are made (?) stunning as they should be.

I am a little confused by the drawings - they not being sufficiently located to get through my rather thick noodle .  I take it that the first drawing - design C so marked in red by me is located between the rear hall and the refectory; and I like it there, I imagine the second drawing - marked in red X by me is located at the entrance of the hall after you have come in from the rear patio.  I suppose it is the ordinary live bedroom lobby and the hall.  I like this too.  WRH

Yours very truly,
