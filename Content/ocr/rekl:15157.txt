MEMORANDUM FOR MISS JULIA MORGAN:

Many of the tents on the hill have blown away in the big storm.  I think it unwise to re-erect tents.

Please instruct Mr. Rossi to build a series of wooden houses to accommodate the workmen.  The work will probably continue on the hill for a sufficient length of time to wholly justify this semi-permanent construction.  I would advise that none of the houses be made very large.  I do not see need for making them much larger than Mr. Tomkins√ï house.  If not too large, they can easily be placed around the hill in various convenient localities.

The men will be more contented, and I really do not think it would cost anymore in the long run than continually putting up tents that are being blown down and frequently buying new tents.

I would like Mr. Rossi to begin on this at once, and to devote his carpenters to this work.

W.R. Hearst.
