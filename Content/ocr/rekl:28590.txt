Dear Miss Morgan:

I think I would like to erect a monument to the heroic airmen who are risking and often losing their lives in the conquest of the air.

There was a splendid column at the Panama Exposition.  What would it cost to erect that column in a permanent form, possibly with some modification?  Where should it be erected, at the University or in San Francisco?

Sincerely

s/ W.R. Hearst
