Dear Miss Morgan:

We have had difficulty with this picture of Marion's, it being a very large and 
difficult one, but I am assured now that the last takes will be on Thursday and if 
so we will surely leave Friday night for the ranch, arriving there Saturday, May 2nd.

I imagine the studies and reports on Mount Olive will wait until then.

I am getting ready with difficulty to scrape up another $25,000 for Mr. Byne in May.  
I suppose he will want it about the 15th.

I sent you an extra $5,000 this month to be devoted to the warehouse.  It seems to
 me that it is good business to build that warehouse and relieve ourselves of warehouse
  expenses elsewhere.

In other respects we will have to go on about as we have been going, on account of 
general conditions, which are punk.  The stock market appears to be going entirely
 out of sight and this may precipitate something in the nature of a panic.  
 Our business is not so terribly bad, but it is not good either and we are fearful 
 the summer months.

I hope things will begin to improve shortly.  They should.

Very sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
