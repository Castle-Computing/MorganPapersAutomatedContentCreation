Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchant's Exchange Bldg., City.

My dear Miss Morgan:

In answer to your recent communication in which, you advise us that Mr. Hearst prefers sending us new covering for Louix XVI suite instead of repairing the antique embroidery - wish to inquire if the special colored taffeta ordered to cover this suite should be delivered to San  Simeon together with the old pieces of embroidery.  We have ordered sufficient material to cover the suite and same could be successfully re-dyed the various tones and made into cushions if desired.

we would be glad to have you advise us when convenient, what disposition you would want us to make of this material.

Yours very truly,
L.Kreiss and sons,
Per.. GKreiss
