December 9th, 1921.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The Sutton Seed left England on November 16th.  It was ordered by the local agent, Sherman T. Blake Co., by order number, which accounts for the difficulty in tracing it in your name.

Do you wish this seed to be raised at the Hacienda and sent down in flats as once mentioned, or raised entirely at Las Estrellas?  This is Mr. Hazzard's query.

With this is a revised Mrs. Hearst's room window trim I overlooked mailing.  If not just right we will try again.

Yours Sincerely,
