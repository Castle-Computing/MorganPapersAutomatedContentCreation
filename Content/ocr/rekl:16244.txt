Rec'd Feb 3rd at Ranch

Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hecox thinks you misunderstood the purpose and plan of his activities.  

Mr. Hecox is merely a financial man. 

 I wanted him to leave what could be done and would be done in the way of finishing certain things and then see what the money was forthcoming to finish them.

For instance - on the outside the colonades and esplanades, - and 
on the inside remaking the fireplaces so they will all draw and not smoke installing the electric heating liberally in the walls, weather stripping, additional furnishing and to make the houses as warm and cozy and livable as possible.

I know that all these things cant be done immediately but they should be done as promptly as possible because the houses are unfinished and uncomfortable
without them

I know that the appropriation is expended in certain major directions and that there may not be enough money to finish certain minor but much needed things.

Therefore I asked Mr. Hecox to find what could be finished and what it would cost and how soon it could be done and to supply certain definite amounts for certain definite objects so as to get the necessary things done as soon as possible.
I don't want him to interfere with anybody.  I simply want him to help in a needed way.

I could do this myself but I have so many other things to do.  I think that situation applies to you too.  I dont like to bother you about such things.  I thought Hecox could be of use in getting the money and seeing that it was devoted to certain objects I hope this meets with your approval 

Sincerely

s/ WR Hearst
