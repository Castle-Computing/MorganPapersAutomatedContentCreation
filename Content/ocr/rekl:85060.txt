Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you for letting me see the Byk "finds." The mantel surely will be useful, 
just a good size for one of the fine rooms over the theatre -- and we could make an 
interesting balcony with the pierced grille as main panel.

I like the Umbrian doorway, but have no key to its size.  If small, it could go in 
the little lobby on the lobby side of the doorway to the Billiard Room, -- this lobby 
to have the little (French) stone ceiling.

I will bring up all you minor architectural stone material on hand here this week end.

Yours truly,
