Dear Mr. Hearst:

We are still standing by program and concentrating, even and although things like lions' dens, duck ponds, miles of fencing, etcetera, are not done at this same time.  We are working all the men it is possible to take care of on the Hill -- stone setters alone forming quite a crew.  Your decision to use the real stone facing is going to be the making of the building.  It is proving less costly than the estimate and looks finely -- the two outside walls of the refectory are almost completed.  The border in the pool is half in, and should be done this week.  The other work is all going ahead as outlined last week.

It was pleasant to see the twins.  They regaled me with great pride with trout (sizes?) of their own catch.

Yours very truly,
