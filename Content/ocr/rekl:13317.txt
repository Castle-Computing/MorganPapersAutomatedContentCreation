January 8, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In regard to the little south terrace of House "A" you recently approved the design for.  Do you wish this carried out in marble to match the little fountain, or in cast stone?  In marble the cost would be about $750.00 and in stone about $450.00
Very truly yours,
JM-GRC
