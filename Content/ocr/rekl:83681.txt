Dear Miss Morgan;

I was heartbroken to find our beautiful urns ruined.  I cannot agree that the packing 
was at fault, they were packed conscientiously padded and completely boxed.  They were 
certainly sufficiently well boxed for all ordinarystresses or jars.

I feel that they were subjected to extraordinary strain.

I am convinced that the trouble was in he boat shipment.

In a car there is merely the handling to the car which is done carefully and 
under supervision.  Then the handlingfrom the car to the warehouse which probably is also done under careful supervision

At any rate we should see that it is.

when we add the boat shipment we ad handling by crane into the boat from 
the dock and out of the boat on to the dock.  Anyone who has seen those cranes or 
derricks work has seen thebump with which loads are often deposited on the hold or on the dock.  That shock 
does the damage I am sure.  As I telegraphed you I would like to eliminate the boat 
transportation altogether.

Some one has said that two movings are equal to a fireand I feel that two movings on and off a boat are equal to a fire and an earthquake.

I think we should always plan to have the fewest handlings possible.

I think cars for the ranch should be loaded at New York with only such stuff as is 
going to the ranch and shouldeither be sent straight to San Luis or should be immediately forwarded from San 
Francisco to Los Angeles without any disturbance.

Then we should have a moving van and transport our stuff directly from the car to 
the ranch in our own van under Mr. Williams' direct supervision.
