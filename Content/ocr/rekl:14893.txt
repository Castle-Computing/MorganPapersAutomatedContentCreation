Dear Miss Morgan,

I favor roses over trellises for the maze 1st because it is impossible to break through the trellises and thus cheat 2nd because I think roses will be very pretty especially if ground at place overhead in arbor form 3rd because such a maze can be made quickly.

What do you think?

Sincerely

The only reason for Yew or cypress maze might be the desirability of making it harmonize with the theatre
