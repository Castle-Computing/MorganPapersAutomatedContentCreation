Dear Mr. Hearst:

We have just received a complete report from Prince Pignatelli in regard to the 
lamps and statues being made in Italy.

1.	The twenty-four lamps being made by Romanelli in Florence are ready and being 
shipped this week.  Prince Pignatelli states that they are beautifully carved and he 
thinks they are exactly what we were trying to get.  He recommends Professor Romanelli 
very highly.

2.	The twenty-six lamps being made by Montani in Florence are finished and are being 
packed for shipment.  These lamps, Prince Pignatelli states, are also very fine.

3.	Five of the eight statues being made by Freter in Pietrasants have been finished 
and will be shipped this week.  The sculptors have been delayed on the other three 
statues on account of difficulty in getting the proper permission to make the casts, 
etc.  The ones that are finished are described to us by Prince Pignatelli as "wonderful 
reproductions" and he is confident that the other three will be equally satisfactory.  
Mr. Freter has been made a payment of one-third of his order and the work is halting on 
account of his having no money for financing his payrolls.  Would you be willing to pay
 him another payment of $1400.00 on his contract?

Yours truly,
s/ T.J.
