July 27, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I cabled Mr. Byne directly after you telephones as follows - 

	"Buy cloister and chapter complete.  Do you advise getting rest of building.  	Find us another cloister".

and today cabled - 

	"Include vaultings"

after receiving your today's telegram.

That is a fine collection of mantel photographs.  The one for the twin's room is very lovely - the big Gothic one most impressive.  I see it eating up the fine little cloister work.  The refrectory is so nearly complete as is, that unless you want to halt it, I would dearly like to see how it will look.  I have kept in mind the possibility of removing the angles at the stair cases, and will put in the least expense possible.

I will draw up the refrectory with the new mantel in it, and you can see just how much it will be necessary to change.

Yours very truly,
