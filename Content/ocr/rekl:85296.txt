Dear Mr. Hearst:

	The Celestial bed rooms are finished 
and furnished, marble window wills, waterproofing, 
shortened doors, ceiling, curtains, etc. included.

The baths are coming along well - the 
stairways done.

	The sitting room is completed outside 
including deck in front, work inside going on well, 
but there is quite a bit of work there yet.

	We are pushing the finish of the North 
Duplex rooms, and the plumbing and electric work is 
under way in the South Duplex rooms, the connections 
made between the circular and duplex stairways at the 
Doges Suite level.

	The concrete walls along the north side 
of House C are being plastered, the new window in the 
lower bed rooms in and all repairs made inside and out.

	I have "vacationed" the indoor pool men 
until we catch up with the work you ask especially for.  
All the craft men were put on the revised wage scale in 
April.

	The tapestry wing drawings are ready for 
your eye any time.  Of course I realize they are for the 
future.  You will be amused to see how the fireplaces 
dwindle - but of course we carry them right up as in the 
refectory.

	Hoping you will soon be at San Simeon - 
I was there yesterday.

Yours truly,
