February 2, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you very much for the extra check for $10,000 just received to help catch up on the over-doing of last summer.

If we receive the January payment in full, and run as budgeted for February, March and April -- by May we will be in normal relationship to our bills again.

Mr. Maybeck's new elevations are ready for your inspection.  The University of California is still clearing the site so we have not lost any actual time.

The tentative studies for the San Francisco Examiner building will be ready for you to criticize by the end of the week - and we have the Neptune Fountain revision also you -- also a "feeler" out for possibilities in the treatment of the new area below the white wall.

If it does not rain Sunday I have promised Mr. Rossi to appear on the hill, on the way up from Los Angeles,

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
