Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed are your annotated letters, which I have read carefully.  I regret having bothered you with so much detail.

Your suggestion with regard to the definite allowance per week or month to be drawn against, would much simplify operations.  We can work to any amount you set.  The average per month for the various years has ranged from $19,000 approximately to $23,000 approximately, this including garden and orchard material as well as building material.  From April onward for six months the work will be heavy and if we could count on $25,000 including the architect's 8 1/2 percent, it would give a good crew and provide for adequate materials and truckage to keep them busy.

I suggested one pay roll (no.11) because both the Mahony Bros. and Mr. Clark, when going over the proposed new organization, seemed to regard it as a weakness in the present system -- not really knowing of course how it worked out in practice.  I will make no changes.

I beg your pardon for the way the paragraph in regard to Mr. Tompkins read, -- the difficulty should have been fully explained or not touched upon only semi-seriously.  As you say, he is a good and useful man, but he also is a problem when you are not on the Hill, due to his lack of discretion.  Having so little to do, the habit has grown on him of impressing the men with his important position and while he cannot of course give orders to the men directly, he does so indirectly to detriment of the work and life of the camp.

We are finishing a flap over a panoramic view looking toward the houses from the orchard, also a study for Chinese hill.

Yours very truly,


Sincerely yours,
JM-deM
