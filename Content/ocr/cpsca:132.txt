Dear Miss Morgan :

Mr. Hearst says regarding the enclosed:

	"Tell Miss Morgan these two ceilings are good if she needs to make any 	more."

Mr. Hearst also asks if you will kindly wire the name of the palace or place where those Sicillian ceilings are located so that he can cable someone to go over there and make color sketches of them so that we can get them exactly as they are.  Awaiting your advice,

Sincerely,
s/ J Willicombe
Secretary to Mr. Hearst.
