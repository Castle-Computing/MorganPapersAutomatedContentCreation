I got your letter and was sorry to hear about the inclement weather.  Of course Italy 
is not winter resort.  I was snowed in once in Genoa for three days.

They talk about the sunny Riviera but it is a snowy Riviera in my recollection.

Also I remember Rome being very cold in winter,-- healthier than in summer perhaps, 
but not so Italian,-- at least not so much like what we conceive Italy to be.

As you go north I am afraid you will run into worse weather, but when you get to 
Germany you will expect bad weather and will not be disappointed.

That is like the story of the many who went to the fortune teller.  After she had 
gone into a trance, she said:

"You are very poor now, and you will continue to suffer from poverty until you are 
forty years of age."

"Yes, yes," said the man, "and then what?"

"Then," said the fortune teller, "you will be used to it."

By the time you get to Germany you will be used to bad weather.

But Germany bad weather is not so bad.  There is lots of nice clean snow, and the 
picturesque villages look even more picturesque with their white bonnets of snow on 
them.

Please see Germany thoroughly.  I am sure you will enjoy it.

I suppose by the time you get this letter you will have been through the Dolemites, 
if the passes are open, and will probably be in Munich.

When you go north from Munich be sure to see Augsberg (there is a lovely hotel there) 
and Nordlingen and Dinkelspuhl, which is a most delightful town, ranking in 
picturesqueness with Nuremberg and Rothenberg.

You should stop a day there.  Then go to Rothenberg and stop two days, and then to 
Nuremberg and stop three days.

After them you may want to go to Wurtzburg and Frankfort?  Or you may want to go to 
Heidelberg and then from there north to Frankort.Miss Morgan-- 2.

Then you should either go to Bingen and down the Rhine, or you should go north 
from Frankfort to Nauheim just for a glimpse, and on to Giesing and down the Lahn 
to Coblentz.

From Coblentz you go along the Rhine to Cologne, and from Cologne of course you will 
go through Holland and Belgium, and finally take the boat at Ostend for England.

Or, perhaps, you will want to go through France and take the boat from Calais.

If you do this properly,-- and you really should do it slowly,-- and if you then 
spend three or four weeks in England, you cannot possibly get any boat leaving March 
15th.  It would be better if you took one leaving April 15th.

You and Miss Head can probably come over together.  She is going to come over for my 
birthday party, and I would like to have you both there.

Please do not hurry home. Have a good time, and make the trip worth all the storms 
and other troubles of the sea voyages.  There is nothing here to call you back.

The interiors of the cottages at Wyntoon have all ben carefully worked out and it 
will be a long time before the wood is carve and ready to put in place.

I do not see how anything of any consequence can be done at Wyntoon before May 
first; and you will be home in time for that under my schedule.

I am writing Miss Head, therefore, to get accommodations somewhere around April 
fifteenth, and I hope this will be in accordance with your ideas.

We had a very jolly Christmas here and I am looking forward to hearing about your 
Christmas in Rome.

Sincerely yours,
