Mr. William Randolph Hearst
La Cuesta Encantada
San Simeon, California 

Dear Mr. Hearst: 
	
	As far as I know you have only 
one painting by Carl Marr out here - "The 
First Communion" now in the River House at 
Wyntoon. 

	There are some small sketches 
by Carl Marr, I think in a box with other
drawings, prints, etc., from the Haciendas.

	The two paintings "Children's 
Party" and "Adoration" from the Phoebe A. 
Hearst Collection are at the University of 
California, Berkeley.

	Very truly yours, 
	
	JM:F
	
	P.S. Could the "Children's Party" have been 
	called "Summer Afternoon"? It was painted the 
	same year and exhibited in Munich.
