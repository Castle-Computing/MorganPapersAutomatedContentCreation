[Letter]

Mr. William Randolph Hearst
137 Riverside Drive
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The report of last week's San Simeon trip is as follows:-

House B:- The finish of the lobby is in place. The lobby work is ready awaiting decision as to the use of the marble columns, one of which is broken. The doors are made and are here in San Francisco waiting transportation. The painters have finished all ceilings except the sitting room, where work is well along.

House C:- The finishers are putting up the trim in the large bedrooms as the new finish for A's bed rooms is not yet ready and I wanted to keep them busy. The exterior lunettes to replace the Della Robbia panels are being set. All doors are finished and hung. The storms halted the work on the grand staircase, although the weather that day was heavenly, and a few days like it would make the quarry road usable.

House A:- The lobby walls are being plastered preparatory putting up the decorations. 

 I am sorry to report the necessity of making another decision on the floor material for the sitting room of A.  The marble men very foolishly got out the material from an untried ledge and did not split the blocks until shipped, when they were found to be defective. As they cannot afford to get it out again, they abandoned the contract, which is a great disappointment. There apparently is left the choice of  

1st,-of a black and white marble floor 

2nd,-the tile at Gump's laid in smaller squares 

3rd,-A mosaic tile floor. I am sending by express a sample we made up in the office of a mosaic floor, the units very small but the overall large enough to be in scale, offering a choice of colors, - in fact quite a range of colors.

Did you find in New York suitable creme marble for the bathrooms?  If not, shall we risk staining the white 
Colorado Yule to an ivory?  Or would you consider an all over stencil (painted) design on a canvassed wall surface.

A drawing of the main room walls of C will be mailed today.  I thought if the spaces for rugs were filled with (or bordered with) a velvet of proper color, the fact that the rugs vary in size and shape would not matter. It the scheme was not a success, the panels could not be filled easily with other decoration. The field of the dodo is of iridescent tile.  Samples of tile will soon be ready to send.  They are in the kiln.  

It was a lovely day "On Top", a sudden warm wave sweeping in with the early morning.

The road above Cambria, also near Morro, is almost impassable, but about a mile of new highway shows how delightful the trip will be some day.

Yours very truly,


The little model of House A is complete but will have to dry out before shipping.

Thank you for the various garden suggestions. The knotty problem of the new turn, the way to end (or begin) the pergola, and the determination that House B shall not be a step-child are being worked on at present.
