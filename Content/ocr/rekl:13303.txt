Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
157 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Hr. Hearst:

I am glad you liked the Venetian balustrade motif€/?M\
for the new wings as it should help to introduce the centraliiﬁwy W
motif and also tie the Spanish and Italian elements together. Mg?”
I was counting on using a different balustrade on the side '1
towards the main terrace -- either repeating the motif of the ‘
gallery balustrade, or making a more simple one yet, igwynh N! .v-
think best. Do you like the big decorative device in the cen- Etﬁawﬁn
ter of the rear facade? The extra four feet makes some kind =aa? ﬁaﬂmt
of a decorative treatment necessary as the plain surface over-(masemamg
powers the Venetian screen otherwise. 6 EN’Cﬂwawmﬁy Am letfwﬁd ‘swms

Would you kindly give your ideas as to the roofing _
of the kitchen proper? Dg_¥an~apprgye it a gabled roof tiledW. _
as shown? I thought it might make a better combination with f9ﬁ§g¢
the cloister on the other side than a continuation of the '«
Venetian balustrade would.

We have nothing to gauge the size, height or extent
of the cloister by except some photographs showing numbered
stones. It would help greatly if we could have a key to the ;
measurements without unpacking the stones and putting them to- ;
gether, also to know whether it is a single one side of a :
cloister or the two sides of one.

 

I will make the details for the plainer of the two
consoles you approved. '

Mr. Rossi has the eSplanade graded and I am going htgp
up to pass on it as soon as the camp Opens. It seemed satis—gwmwgM
factory last week except to the south west of the kitchen ﬁwpwgwwipwf
where three trees. two in good condition and one scrubby, make wwwwﬁgw
either quite a detour outward necessary to go around all three gkj_%£ ,
or else taking out the center one which happens to be the scrub&ggggwyé
with its upper branches rotted off. I do not think it would Lﬁa %WM#4:
be missed as the branches of the other two trees meet over it,_.'£ Q r$f
and the eSplanade would pass under these branches and between ztt‘fgﬁhtf
the two quite good youngish trees. (wwwggé.gmjglwng

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
December 29, 1925.

Some alternate studies for the interior of the
billiard room are nearly completed,using in one case your
big blue and gold Italian doorway, and in the alternate
treatment twisted columns, as you have such a large collect-
ion of these so far unused.

Yours very truly,
