Dear Miss Morgan:

I do not think we should use the best quality of paddock fence, for two reasons, 
first, because it is difficult to place over the hill, according to the report, and 
second, it is obviously too conspicuous.  It is much more noticeable as fencing than 
the other kind with the wide weave, or whatever you might call it.

We are not starting to put in some fencing down the ridge near the red rock to about 
where we will locate the lower lodge.

The important thing in this fencing is to have it coyote proof.  Will you kindly 
instruct Mr. Rossi carefully on this point?

2.  I need alittle iron work for the bungalow at the studio.  I imagine we have 
plenty at San Simeon of the kind that I want.  I want a balcony about 6 to 8 feet 
wide and I want a couple of grilles about 6 feet high and 4 feet wide.

I will send you early next week exact dimensions, but of course it is not necessary 
to have these things fit exactly.  If they can come somewhere near fitting they will
 be available.

Very sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
