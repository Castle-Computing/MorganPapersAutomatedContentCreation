Dear Miss Morgan:

In thinking over what you had to say about the steel,-- I find that I am not in a position to begin work on the University museum at present.

I have just bought some papers in Pittsburgh and it has left me pretty well exhausted for ready money.

After a few months, I will know whether the papers are going to make money or lose it.  If they make it, they can take care of their own obligations, and I will probably be in a position to go ahead with the University work.

It will be some time-- probably six months-- before this situation clarifies.

I spoke to you the other night about the possibility of doing something in a moderate way to keep busy.

We could cover the Greek Theatre with marble, and the cost of that would not be more than forty or fifty thousand dollars; and that would not be a very severe strain.

But the matter of five or six hundred thousand dollars for museum work would be.

I will talk to you about these things when I see you again, but in the meantime, I do not think it is wise to do anything that might commit us to construction of the museum at the moment.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
