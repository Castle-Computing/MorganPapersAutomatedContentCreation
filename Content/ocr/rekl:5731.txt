Dear Miss Morgan:

I have been thinking over house C, and I have come to the conclusion that we would better abandon entirely the wall treatments of the sitting room of house C and start on an entirely new decorative scheme.

I have a lot of Italian velvet with appliques, red and yellow, that I had intended using in the sitting room of the main central house, but I   believe it would be very good for use in the sitting room of house C.

I has a valance and there is enough of it to completely cover the walls-- probably more than enough.  It is exceedingly handsome stuff and would make a very stunning room if stretched from the frieze, which is not deep, down to the baseboards.

I do not mean to use it merely in panels but to use it on all the wall space, except the space occupied by the doors and windows and the mantelpiece.  I think you would have a stunning middle room for house C with this treatment. 

Then for the sitting room of the main central house, when that is constructed, I have bought two sets of Renaissance tapestries. One is a set of four, dealing with the life of Scipio Africanus. They are 14 1/2 feet deep and 23 or 24 feet ling. I would like to place these four as follows:

 Two over the windows and on either side of the entrance door on the front side of this room; two over the windows on either side of the room. 

I have another pair of tapestries which might go at the back of the room. All of these tapestries which might go at the back of the room. All at these tapestries could be hung high enough to five room for a window space of eight or nine feet. 

I am also getting a set of twenty Renaissance stalls, which I think would go around the room in the spaces between the doors and windows. These stalls are between eight and nine feet high. I think there will be enough of them, because the window and door spaces are large, and there will not be so very much space between them. 

I am going to send you the measurements of these tapestries and of these stalls accurately so that you can plan out their use in this way. 

This scheme will probably require a room some six feet higher than we originally planned it, but I think we will get a wonderful ef-
fect with this layout; and besides, the ceiling I have is so heavy that it will look best in a very high room. 

In addition to the measurements, I will also send you photographs of stalls and tapestries so you will have a full knowledge of all the furnishings. 

The material that I spoke of for use in house C has been sent to the Hacienda. There were some tapestries sent out at the same time, and in one of the boxes you will find this material. 

Sincerely Yours,
