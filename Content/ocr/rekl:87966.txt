Dear Miss Morgan:

Please visit ALKMAAR in Holland and see the Cheese Market chimes.

They succeed in doing what we are not able to do here at the ranch.

They get the little bells tingling and jingling together in quick time, and there 
is not that labored effort that we have with our bells on the Hilltop.

I would suggest that you have some engineer look into the matter, so we can apply 
the principle to our bells, which we never use.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan
