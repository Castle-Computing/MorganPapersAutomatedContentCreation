c/o The Ambassador Hotel,
Loo Angeleo, California.

Deer mr. Hearst:

so have been etuﬁying the problem of hot water
for the small houses. especially House "A". The hot
water for this house is supplied by two electric hot
water heaters of 60 gallon capacity each. and each
having two electric hosting elements. This gives
a total storage of 120 gallons to supply the six baths
in the house which is much more than is usually alloW~

o ed for ordinary use.

However, it is possible to put the entire.con~
tents of one boiler is cos of the large bath tubs but
so this water should be at s tempcreturo of arounﬂ
150 to 160 degrees. it seems very unlikely that this
would ever occur. However, shon17 toe entire contents
of one of the boilers be arson at one time. it would
require approximately one hour for this boiler of water

-to be reuhestso.

It has occurred to us that possibly the heating
elemeote in these boilers are not functionino to full
efficiency and so are having this point looked into.

If we find that the heating elements are in proper sorkn
ing order, and still greater storage capacity of hot
water is desired. it can quite easily be secured by
placing on additional storage boiler alongside ono coo»

, nected to each of the present boilers, by which means

we could get any storage capacity desired. If we were
to place a 60 gallon storage boiler alongside of each
hector, we would have a total hot water storage for
sense "A" of 240 gallons, which woulo be 40 gallons
for each tub, if they were all filled simultaneously.~

.e would be glee to have you let us know if you
think that much water would ever be needeo.

Very truly yours.
