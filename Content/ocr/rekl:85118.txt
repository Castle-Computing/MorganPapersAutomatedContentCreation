March 4th, 1932.

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan,

In the absence of Mr. Dodge I am writing to supply additional data requested 
concerning the jar.

The rim of the cover has been traced on enclosed sheet.  The design of cover and 
jar is harmonious, blue background with vari-colored flowers, leaves, et cetera; 
cover and jar appear to be contemporary.  The knob is a small gilded dog, quite 
clearly outlined in the enclosed photograph. 

I hope that this information will make definite identification possible.

Very truly yours,

s/ Charles C. Wall
