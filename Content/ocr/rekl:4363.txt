New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This week I did get to the Top with the aid of a four mule road team part way. The county road by the Los Ossos Valley above the lagoon is in inexcusable shape, and elsewhere the ruts are so deep the low type autos simply cannot make it.

The painters are working in the northwest bedroom of B and have started on the sitting room.  Washburn is setting up the window and door decorations as fast as the ceiling scaffold is moved, - so "B" looks hopeful.  The mantel is up and finished. It fits perfectly in width but stands out more than seemly.  How would it do to use the over mantel (enclosed) that came with the mantel of the big room of main building.  It could be made to fit. Otherwise some kind of filler as a transition will have to be devised, as it would spoil the ceiling design to bring out the face of the breast.

Van Der Loo is working on the last details of Lobbys, revamped to fit heights of new columns. The continuous bad weather makes little outside work possible. The concrete is poured for A's lower terrace and the work stripped. I am keeping Van Der Loo on interiors until they be done, as he can quickly catch up with stone work afterwards and his small crew is effective used in this way.

There is a model in process of the lower pergola showing the connection from lower terrace to lower terrace. Shall I send it to you when completed or keep it here?  It will be finished by the time you receive this,- then I will start studies on the turn you wish at the foot of the main steps.

For the winter the road gang is encamped at the lower turn, with truck sheds, etc.  not exactly ornamental.

Yours very truly,
