Dear Miss Morgan:

I have authorized Mr. Reesing to buy flowers to carry out some of the projects I have discussed 
with him up to a thousand dollars, more or less.

I have sent him a letter, copy of which I enclose.

I do not object to the amount of flowers he ordered, but I think you should talk the matte 
rover with him or have Miss Worn talk with him and make sure that the specific orders are the 
right kind and color to give the desired effect.

I told Mr. Reesing that I wanted to start the season with the early spring bulbs, such as tulips
 and hyacinths.

I would like to use those in the formal beds.  They do not last very long but they are very 
beautiful, if properly selected, while they do last.

We have so many formal beds now that it is important to get lovely flowers for them and to
 have a succession of fine effects.

Moreover, as I am getting to live here most of the time, I think we can alter our program a 
little and provide blooms for the whole year.

I also told Mr. Reesing I was sweet peas and we selected beds where we thought we could use 
them.

I told him I thought we should have a regular flower show at each season of the year for the 
flowers which bloom at that season.

The succession of flowers was tulips, hyacinths, sweet peas, madonna lillies, peonies, sweet 
Williams, petunias, gladioli, dahlias, asters, stocks, and wall flowers.

I also told him to get some poinsettas for late fall bloom, and put them in protected places
 against the white walls of the houses; and to get some hollyhocks for summer bloom in similar
 positions.

I think Mr. Reesing has a pretty good general idea of what is wanted, but it may be necessary 
to make sure that the proper taste is exercised in selecting the flowers for color effects.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
