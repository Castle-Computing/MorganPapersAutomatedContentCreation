Dear Hearst:

On the Hill Tuesday everyone was very busy trying their best to live up to schedule -- and doing it -- on the average.  The big room is dismanteled as it was necessary to get up the moving scaffold to replace the ceiling corner moulding.  I hope the stalls will come shortly.  The opportunity was taken to send to San Francisco one of the Scipio tapestries to be lined.  The necessary linen could not be had last year in this country and when imported, the room was in use.

Your road map was mailed to you last night.  Mr. Tudor (in charge of the road work) will press the work from the Neptune cross-axe around to the new turn below the Morgan well.  This seems necessary as the dirt and dust it makes should be out of the way before plastering the exterior of the Main Building.  The dust from the road work below, if that part is a little delayed would not matter so much.

We are running much beyond our budget -- to make any effect we have to,  apparently.  Material bills can be carried and met later in the season, but the labor bills may make some help necessary by the end of the month.  You said to let you know.

Mr. Rossi has not been asked to begin on the pantries and kitchen as he is doing all he can to carry program up to June.  Shall he finish these rooms in June, or shall we put all June efforts on the exterior of the Building and the Library?

Yours very truly,
