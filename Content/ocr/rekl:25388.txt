Dear Mr. Hearst:

On the Hill yesterday the steam shovel was gaily at work - already making quite a hole in the tennis court.

Mr. Meyberg went over the lanterns, standards, etcetera, and will send up suitable workmen to fit up the various pieces, and will submit to you drawings for various possible treatments of the more important standards.

The pool work is nearing completion.  The stone setters are on the facing stone, and the Gothic suite, kitchen wing, etcetera, items are all underway -- perhaps "scattering" too much, but I see no other way of getting it done - the workmen all being of different trades or capacities.

Mr. Neylan, on the tenth, sent a check for $20,000 which is already spent.  Do you come to the rescue or do I pursue Mr. Neylan before he has time to relax?

Yours very truly,
