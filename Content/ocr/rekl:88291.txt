Grand Hotel - Roma

Aug. 21, 1936.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst gave me this letter to send you and I made a copy for the file; am sending 
you duplicate, in case you cannot read all the writing.

We got to Naples on the 15th and arrived here on the 18th-- leaving Sunday the 23rd 
for Florence, and expect to reach Venice (Excelsior Hotel-- The Lido) on the 27th.

From there we go (I cannot state date) through Austria to Bad Nauheim, where we may 
remain from two to four weeks-- and last to St. Donat's-- SAILING ON QUEEN MARY OCT 28.

Best Wishes--

J WILLICOMBE
