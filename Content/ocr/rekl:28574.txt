Dear Miss Morgan:-

Mr. Hearst addressed me the following letter this morning:-

'Dear Mr. Rossi:-  The rains will soon be here and there is a lot of work which must be done on the roads and fences.  Draining the roads properly is a big job and much remains to be done.  I would like Mr. Gillespie given the roads and fences just like Mr. Keep has the orchard and Mr. Macklen the garden.  Please dont take Mr. Gillespie off his department any more than you would take Mr. Keep off his orchard work.

First I would like the roads thoroughly drained.

Second I would like walls built along the road where the sinks occur.

Third I would like the places where the two roads cross and such uneven spots straightened out and properly graded and marked.  I think the two roads can be maintained, but I do not insist on this.

Fourth I would like the fences and gates all made Coyote, Fox and Coon proof.

Fifth I would like the fences for the new orchard put away down the hill out of sight;  I showed Pancho where.

Sixth I would like the outside fences as well as inside made Coyote proof, and 

Seventh would like all banks prepared for Mr. Keep.

All this will surely keep Mr. Gillespie busy.

P.S. I don't know how big a crew Mr. Gillespie needs.  I think we should decide that matter definitely and as soon as possible.	Signed W.R.H.'

Sincerely yours.

s/ CC Rossi
