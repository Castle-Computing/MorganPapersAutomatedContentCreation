Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards Mrs. Lee and the set of marquetry furniture you offered to give her.  At the time I wrote her about it she was living in a small apartment in San Jose and could not take care of it.  After moving to the Pleasanton ranch she wrote that she would appreciate having it very much.  There was a delay in shipping it to her owing to my not having released it from Bekin's Warehouse, but it is safely in her possession now.

Yours very truly,
