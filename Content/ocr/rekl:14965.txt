December 9, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.  Mr. Joy has some developed sketches for you, when you want them and him.

2.  Work may seem quiet at San Simeon because the budget this month and next is spent with more of it on work by Mr. Lorenze on bookcase carving of library, Mr. Suppo on last panels of big frieze and kitchen wing cornice, Mr. Van der Loo on ceilings of library and vestibule and the last of the work for the Doges Suite, Mr. Miletin on San Sovino trim for vestibule, last of main doorway two of the new candelabra, floor of loggia, etc.  Mr. Trinkkeller just home from Spain is to go onto the big window grilles of main room - quite a program.

3.  Mr. Rossi has finished the new stair extensions of the towers, which I would like to know your impressions of - (I like them). He is finishing the new animal cages, has pout both flues into your fireplace and put in a damper, (if this is a success, will make it turn by a handle through the breast), is progressing on the moving of the first oak.  He has plenty of work ahead!

4.  The chicken house man was late in arriving.  His name is Spengler and he comes from the engineer's office at Salinas, very well recommended.  One has to choose for temperaments as well as skill to sandwich successfully between the various San Simeon personalities.  He seemed the most promising of many looked up.  Am budgeting $5000 a month out of your Hill allowance for this work, and providing a small separate camp on the site - planning to et contracts for plumbing, plastering, painting, etc. to San Luis Obispo people, - all this if satisfactory to you.
5.-  The storm sash on the cloister gallery will be up by Christmas.

6.  Myself will be on the High Seas Christmas on way home from Honolulu where to I set sail today.  This was why I went to San Simeon Sunday, checking up to see that everyone understood what he had ahead to do.  It was a heavenly day.

7.  Also went over to the Pleasanton warehouse and after spending a full day there realize that much future saving of time and expense can be avoided by segregation of the material before it leaves there., also an elimination of material evidently not worth keeping longer, is needed.  Experimenting all day with Mr. Fairchild and Bekins Van & Storage Company's best man, I found they did not recognize the scattered parts of objects or collections or realize what was personal and what not, and that it would take quite a little personal time to identify objects and get related things together.  Another difficulty is that the inventory was taken by listing boxes, what was on certain shelving, etc. as such or saying they contained such objects, and as soon as  shifted, there was no possibility of checking.  Thinking it over carefully, it seems as though the quickest way would be to gather definite groups of objects together and then ask you to say what you want done with each such group,- such as Indian collections (to be stored at San Simeon, Bekin's or Stringer's?) collection of early American wood utensils, - number of badly shaped and colored flower vases of no great first value,- large collection of electric fans for ole type current, - etc. etc.

I will do this gladly the first of the year, if this will meet the needs.

Yours very truly,
