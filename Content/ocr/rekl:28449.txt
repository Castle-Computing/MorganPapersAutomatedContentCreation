Dear Mr. Hearst:

The marble is in the big pool except that they are setting the border, all material for which is on the ground.

The gymnasium pools under the tennis courts are excavated and the form work begun.  This Recreation Building is quite a big structural job in itself.  Mr. Rossi agreed to push ahead with the handball court and rear walls as fast as possible so as to replace the original court -- and then push the structural work on the outer part so as to make usable the second court as soon as possible.

The items on your House A list are nearly all done.  I am not letting the other houses be touched until all items in A are checked off as completed.

The Gothic Sitting Room ceiling is in and Gyorgy is finishing it.  It took some real good nature on the part of the "wormers" to match up new with old work. The other two ceilings are up and Gyorgy's work on them well along.

The Library Lobby woodwork is nearly ready for Gyorgy's men -- and this, also the Cloister passage doors and floors will be ready surely by July.

The stonework on outside of the main building looks very well - work was started on the Refectory walls so as to get the "men's hands" in" for the more prominently seen work on the front and towers.  Some of the tower cast stonework also is up, and an idea of the final effect makes one quite happy.

The hardware situation has been steadily worse, as no one on the hill understands the putting on or repair of fine work, knowing which, you may have noticed no good hardware has been bought recently --

just "bungalow" material that could be used at San Simeon.  I took up the best hardware man I know of Monday and went over all the hardware problem in the same detailed way the fixtures were gone over with Mr. Meyberg.  He will send up the necessary parts with a first class man and put all hardware in order.

Yours very truly,
