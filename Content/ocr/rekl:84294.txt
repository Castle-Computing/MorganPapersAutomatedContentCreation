Dear Miss Morgan:

On page two hundred nineteen in the March issue of the "House Beautiful" is an 
advertisement of the Hoffman Controlled Heat apparatus.  Would this not be advisable 
to use where we have steam heat at the ranch, although we do not have it much?

I also notice in the advertisement a process for putting moisture into the air down 
in the basement instead of having vessels filled with water upstairs in rooms.  
We might be able to utilize this also.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
