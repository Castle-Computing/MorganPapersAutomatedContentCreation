Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Rossi's copy of your "sailing orders" are just received -- and I will do my best 
to follow them up -- all but the showers in House A you had in come way indicated.

Mr. Rossi has all the drawings, structural and otherwise, for the North Terrace,--- 
complete,--except the new stair motif balancing House B which we settled upon Sunday 
and for which drawings are now being developed.

As to the pool, I think the best thing will be to put in the windows and the mosaic 
lining of the pool without the pavement around it -- and then in the spring, paper it
 all over and thoroughly protect it otherwise, before the rest of the work is begun. 
  How does this strike you?  I am afraid the cementing of the pool would injure the 
  bonding of the mosaic to the walls later on.  There is only so much suction to the 
  concrete.

Yours very truly,
