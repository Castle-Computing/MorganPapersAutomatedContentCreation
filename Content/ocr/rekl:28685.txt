Dear Miss Morgan:-

I telegraphed you my fear of the cost of raising the roof on the house.  I also have some ideas as to the appearance, but of course you know best about that.

I hope you will send me some drawings, as well as photographs, of the model, because the model as a rule does not photograph very well.

I imagine if the roof could be carried forward, on the outside at least, as far as the construction we have erected beyond the Towers and the viaduct, or arch or whatever you would call it, in which we have the bathrooms for the Upper Tower bedrooms-----If, as I say, the roof was carried that far forward externally, at least, it might avoid anything queer looking.  The higher roof would then, as it were, hide behind this construction in front and the Towers would mask it on the sides.

There still remains the cost.  I imagine it would be ghastly.  In fact, it might be possible to build a whole new house----such as we purpose erecting on the North and on the South of the Big House----for what it would cost to make this roof an idea habituation.

I am awaiting your figures on this matter.

Pleas find enclosed a couple of interesting pages on orchard and gardening developments.

Sincerely,

s/ W R Hearst
