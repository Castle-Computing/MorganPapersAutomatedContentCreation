Honorable William Randolph Hearst,
New York,
New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I enclose a letter received from Julia Morgan which is self-explanatory insofar as it 
refers to a communication addressed to her by the writer requesting the privilege of  
visiting the San Simeon Estate for the purpose of determining what could be done to 
assist you in the eradication of the Pine Bark Beetle and such other insect pests as 
might be causing loss and proving difficult and expensive to control.  Through the 
american Green Cross I desire to offer our services in order to demonstrate to you our 
ability to solve some of the problems connected with this situation, having in mind 
especially, the editorial which appeared in the Los Angeles Examiner on March 30th, 
1931.  In this editorial appears the recommendation "Congress should furnish Millions 
of Dollars for Pacific Coast Campaign against this Pest."  "Pine Borer".

We have ample ground for stating that with the Green Cross Insect Tap we can 
completely eradicate from any property, not alone the Pine Borer but the Japanese 
Beetle, Coddling Moth, all forms of Aphis, Leaf Hoppers, Bean Borers, Mosquitoes, 
etc.  This seems like a tall contract to undertake, notwithstanding which if  you 
will refer us to your representative in any particular section on the Coast where you
 would care to have a demonstration made we will be glad to do so without expense to 
 you and with the conviction that we will be able to fully satisfy you that these 
 claims are not exaggerated.

You are undoubtedly familiar with the stupendous loss caused by insect pests, not 
alone through the destruction of crops and timber but through the vast expenditure 
of money for insecticides which in turn poison the bird lifePage 2.

and creates a vicious circle of increased insect pest.

These machines are not in the experimental stage but they have had actual field 
operation and commercial use for several years and we are now prepared to offer them 
in quantity production, amply financed by a reputable manufacturer in Los Angeles.

It has been known for some years that one of the principle factors in the control of 
insect pests would be some form of light.  Large sums have been expended by the 
Government in experiments with only partial success,- the difficulty having been to 
destroy the insects when they were attracted and to do this economically and 100% 
efficient.  Also, certain insects would not approach a white light during the season 
which they were laying eggs.  Our apparatus, which is of substantial construction 
and attractive appearance, consists of a receptacle supported by four metal legs, 
the receptacle itself being similar to the bottom of a water cooler and being filled 
almost to the over-flowing point with water on the top of which is a certain amount 
of crude oil.  From the center of this circular resevoir extends a powerful electric 
light of about 200 watts.  This light is partially surrounding by a large, 
highly-polished, nickle-plated reflector, the whole being surrounded over the 
top by a sliding hemispherical cover to protect it in case of rain.  The nickle-plated 
reflector has perforations near the base and on the back of the reflector and in line 
with these perforations are containers containing a highly-seductive bait.  The heat 
from the lamp displaces the air causing the odor of the bait to arise to some height
 where it is diffused through the atmosphere.  The insects are attracted by both 
 the light and the odor of the bait.  They fly in swarms toward the light and the 
 bait odor, circle once or twice, and take a nose-dive into the container of the water 
 and oil.  Those that are able to crawl out with their wings covered with oil are 
 assisted by a sort of a ladder arrangement on the side of the container from which 
 point they crawl over the edge and drop into a receptacle where they perish.

Large numbers do not crawl out but remain in the oil and the gradual accumulation of
 these insects causes a very slight displacement of the liquid contents of the 
 container so that their bodies gradually work toward the edge Page 3.

and into the trap receptacle, it being only necessary from time to time to make a 
slight renewal of the oil and to empty these receptacles of the insect bodies.

The results are amazing and at times almost funny to observe the vast swarms of 
insects in a perfect tornadoe entering the machine.

If affidavits and testimonials are convincing, we have plenty.  One case in particular 
of an orchardist in the Salt River Valley, Utah, who having had crop failures for 
six or seven year, equipped his property with these machines and I am informed 
produced 35,000 boxes of perfect apples which received first prize at the State 
Horticultural Exhibit.  Needless to say he has entirely discarded all spray material 
and apparatus.  I have been informed that one of the largest apple buyers on the 
Pacific Coast, namely Rivers Brothers, in Los Angeles, paid this man a premium for 
his fruit over other growers.

We are conducting a test on the Moore Ranch at Saticoy, Ventura County, this week for 
the control of a walnut pest in co-operation with Mr. Brubaker, U.S. Government 
Entemologist.  We have not given this to the Press as yet and would ask you to consider 
this as confidential until it is released.

The writer was confidential representative in the Fire Department and Fire Prevention 
Bureau for the Honorable John F. Hylan at that time Mayor and at present Judge of the 
Childrens' Court, New York City.  I will be happy to have you communicate with Judge 
Hylan as I feel sure he will be glad to endorse the writers' reliability and business 
standards.

Again I had the pleasure of visiting your San Simeon Estate on one or two occasions 
and I have a slight acquaintance with Mr. Arthur Brisbane with whom I discussed forestry 
matters enroute from Washington to New York in September, 1929.  I am also acquainted 
with Mr. Reginald Fernald of the Santa Barbara Morning Press, Mr. David Coolidge 
formerly of Boston and now of Santa Barbara.Page 4.

I have been obliged to go to some length in explaining the plan, feeling sure that 
you would forgive me for trespassing upon your time in view of the importance of the 
subject.

Yours very truly,

s/ Frederick H. Cowles.

CHAIRMAN FIRE PREVENTION COMMITTEE.
