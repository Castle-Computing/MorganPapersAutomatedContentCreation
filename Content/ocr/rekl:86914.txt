Dear Miss Morgan:

You are entirely right about this material in the warehouses.  I think by sorting out 
the less valuable material we can find enough room in the warehousess we now have for 
the more valuable stuff.

I also think the idea of storing in the rooms themselves, the ceilings, etc., which are 
to be used in them, is excellent.

I am glad to be able to save the money which the new warehouse would cost.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco, Calif.
