Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
New York American,
New York, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
The marble walls, etc. for the Doges suite is being made and will all be in place by the first of May. There re-mains yet to order the wash basins -- made of the darker "rosata", basins integral with the slab like in your House A rooms, they will cost $1120,00 with legs as shown in the en-closed cut or duplicating those in house A. Do you want curtains or doors at the showers? If doors, see enclosed cuts and prices.
We could get marble slabs with porcelain bowls at a small portion of the cost of the one piece ones.
If we male new models for the standards it will considerably increase the cost.
The rooms are taking shape nicely. The only worry is as to the sitting room wall covering. The pieces sent not match-ing the pattern, lengths, etc., have asked French to send all they have in hopes of getting enough for one pattern. The color is fine- and it will quite break my heart if it will not do.
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
