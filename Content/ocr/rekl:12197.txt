Dear sir:

I duly received your kind letter May 16th.  ult. and I have been expecting the visit of Mr. Hearst all this time.

I read in fact in the papers that he was in Genoa and I fully thought he would give me a call in Venice.  Instead I am learning now by the same papers that Mr. Hearst returned to America and has arrived to New York already.

I am thinking how a meeting with Mr. Hearst could be possible.  I been four times at San Francisco for the Stanford order, but just now I am not sufficiently well to undertake the journey.

If however you would kindly explain me what Mr. Hearst wish and if the tesseras of the pictures should be much smaller what I expected to do, please let me know by return of mail and I shall prepare some colored sketches which will give you a full idea of what I propose to make.

with best regards,
Yours very truly,

s/Salviati
