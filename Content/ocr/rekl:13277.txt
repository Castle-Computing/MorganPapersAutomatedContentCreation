Dear Miss Morgan:

The main building looms so large that the landscape architecture should be built to scale with it.  I advise making approaches, stair flights, walls, and general effects with big main building in mind.

I think stairs on each side of temple also cross axis entrances and approaches, also rear entrance, also effects seen from distance, should be sufficiently monumental; to tie in with main central house motif.

Is this all right?

Sincerely
s/ WR Hearst
