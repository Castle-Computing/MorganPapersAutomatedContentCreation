MISS JULIA MORGAN, ARCHITECT--MERCHANTS EXCHANGE BUILDING
SANFRANCISCO CAL

APPROVE SKETCHES FOR HOUSE A BEDROOMS BUT MRS HEARST PREFERS ROSE AND GOLD VALENCE FOR HER ROOM PLEASE PROCEED BUT DONT USE ACTUAL DOOR FRAME FROM CITY OF PARIS SAVE THAT FOR SECOND FLOOR REAR SUITE IN MAIN BUILDING AS WE PLANNED COPYING MOTIVE NOW  I IMAGINE THIS IS WHAT YOU PURPOSE DOING I THINK IT WILL BE GREAT INCONVENIENCE TO HAVE AUTOMOBILES COMPELLED TO GO ALONG THE PAVED ROAD PAST ALL THE HOUSES TO TURN IS NT POSSIBLE TO HAVE A TURN BEFORE REACHING THE HOUSES B SO THAT VISITORS CAN BE LANDED AT FIRST MAIN BUILDING STEPS THERE I ADVOCATED THIS AT ONE TIME KINDLY CONSIDER IT.
