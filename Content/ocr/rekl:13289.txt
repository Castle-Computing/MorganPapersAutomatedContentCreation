YOU ARE CORRECT ABOUT MAIN BLDG SCALE.  THINK SWIMMING POOL BLDG WILL CORRECT EFFECT OF SLIGHTLY OVER LARGE MASS FOR PRESENT HOUSES THINK APPLICATION OF DETAIL WILL DO MUCH TO BRING INTO SCALE. (?) MASS WELL FROM A DISTANCE AND FENCE ESPLANADE WILL FOLLOW YOUR INSTRUCTIONS AND STUDY OUT LARGER SCALE APPROACHES ETC.  WELL FORMED CEILING ETC FOR NEAR LOWER BEDROOM WILL WRITE FULLY.
