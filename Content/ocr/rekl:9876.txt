Dear Miss Morgan :

This alternative suggestion for house A-- attached hereto-- seems the safest.

I will use it on A and use the same design or something similar on B for the chimney tops.

On house C I would suggest using the tile because there is more tile in house C and because, also, being more of a Moorish house, there is better opportunity to use the tile.

The house B chimney top drawing is very attractive and should go well on house C.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
