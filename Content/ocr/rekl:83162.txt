Dear Mr. Hearst:

There is a good deal of work done since your last Hill visit, but much scattered. 
 The lines of the North Terrace steps at the road and the wall on the upper side of the 
 main center portion of the terrace perhaps can be bettered, now that the stripped slabs 
 and walls bring out the new relationships.

The marble in the lower A baths will be in by the end of the week.

Shall the Gothic Suite baths be finished in marble?  It was planned for mosaic originally.

Your letter outlining the winter work is received.  I do not think the last pourings of
 the accessories to the North Terrace development, or of the Recreation Wing, will be 
 done this week, but think both these and the music room section can be done by the end 
 of the month -- and then as you outline, we can do indoor work such as the Celestial
  Suite rooms, and entrances, the Roman pool linings, etcetera -- and pay up our 
  "installment plan purchases",--build up our supply of tile, modeling and cast work, 
  carving, etcetera, for the spring again.

Miss Worn will be on the Hill for Sunday.  If you prefer to have me come for Saturday, 
I can arrange to do so.

Yours very truly,
