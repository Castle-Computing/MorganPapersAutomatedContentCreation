Dear Mr. Hearst:

We had to make a custom payment, although under protest, and could send Mr. Rossi toward this week's pay roll only what we had left on hand, $1550.00  His pay roll was $2121.79 for last week, the garden and orchard rolls were $132.44 and the modeling and carving roll $670.00 -- a deficit this week of $2934.13.  There will be one more similar pay roll this month.

We cannot meet our material bills on our allowance with a total pay roll of much over $10,000.00 per month.  Next month we will have to meet the contract bills for the warehouses in addition to the regular bills.

This detail explaining why I had cut down the pay rolls.

Yours very truly,
