Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your cable from Paris saying - "PLEASE DON'T MAKE SMALL INDOOR POOL SHALLOW MAKE IT 
SHELVING FROM THREE AND HALF FEET TO BOOM OF BIG POOL" has just been received.  
This is the way it was intended to show it on the drawing sent you, and it is being 
built that way.

Yours very truly,
