Dear Mr. Hearst

[Handwritten: to the Beach House]

Your cabled instruction as to replacing wood basement stud walls where opened up, 
with concrete instead of wood, has been followed, and yesterday the last concrete was 
poured -- giving you a concrete wall under the columns nearly along the whole frontage, 
including those carrying the third story sun room.  The marble is being replaced, and 
the premises should be in good shape by the end of the month.

The dust from the dirt road in front has been excessively bad this summer.  I have 
been wondering if the dirt spaces could not be oiled.  It would be so much less in 
cost than continual repaintings.

At the Hill, the tennis court wall forms are about ready for the concrete pour. The 
steel girders are being placed over the music rom -- plastering work goes ahead inside 
the theater.  Would you mind cabling whether you want the gold - gold-leaf like 
elsewhere, or just "German gold", i.e. gilt paint.  Those big figures and surfaces 
will take a good deal of material, and the work of gold-leafing will be slow at best.

The tree men are at work on the burnt oaks, starting on the ones nearest roads.  
There is no work being one on the pergola proper, all columns being placed as mentioned 
in the last letter, but Mr. Rossi has carried the finished level along quite a 
distance on the north side -- as far as practical to do without the shovel.

The castle model is very pretty - like a little dream.

With kindest regards,

Yours very truly,
