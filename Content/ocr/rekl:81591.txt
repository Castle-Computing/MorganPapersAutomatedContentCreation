Dear Mr. Hearst:

Operations were certainly active on the Hill yesterday.  The animal enclosure, quite a job, will be completed this week.  Mr. Rossi made a very nice piece of work of it.  We are moving the warehouse loading platform and doors to the Hill end, as the trucks were wasting time making way through the spaces between cages, and endangering visitors' lives incidentally.

The shovel is ready to come out of the big pool excavation, but considerable hand work is necessary before the forms can be put in.  The last of your family left the Hill yesterday and I asked Mr. Rossi to begin work on the Tennis Court area at once as it is a real development and it will take careful following up in order to have the courts replaced by Christmas.  Enclosed is a sketch for your suggestions.  May we not get this work safely advanced with its terraces on the esplanade level before working on the new Patio Wing?

The Main Building terrace is about to the pouring stage and looks well.

Hadley was working on the changes on the south 'Earring', - has made very good progress on the various pavements.

Three very beautiful cypress from Paso Robles are on the Hill and Mr. Rossi so enthused that he is tackling the lowering of the 'C' terrace wall! and a good bit of the balustrades on both sides the big Neptune terrace walls are up.

Also, all the marble columns, caps, etc. have arrived for the pavilions, and there is so much to do, I do not dare even touch them.  The elevator machinery

is being placed.  The Chicken Farm drawings are a really complete set and foundation work there is underway, -- also giraffe enclosures.  It was a happy busy day.  Never saw lovelier flowers anywhere, and wondered what you might be seeing.

Wyntoon work is progressing very well.  It is feasible to finish the pool and its operating equipment, and perhaps lay the concrete for the tennis courts.  This will ge the heavy dirty work out of the way, and the court enclosures could be placed quickly next year.  The heater room is a concrete box at present, but will be entirely covered by the river pavilion.  Perhaps you will bring a grand inspiration for this.

I will do as you ask in seeing foundation conditions at Santa Monica, with Mr. Flannery and Mr. Hellenthal this week.

I do hope you are have a Grand Time.

As always

Yours very truly,
