Dear Mr. Hearst:

The theater carpet and chair coverings are selected and ordered, -- the hanging being 
lined -- the theater being plastered -- many of the pilaster-caryatids are cast and 
ready to set.  The hanging covers the side walls from stage platform to music room 
entrance, both walls, but no more.  There are several solutions for the balance of 
the wall surfaces, which can wait your return.

The walls around the tennis courts are being formed.  As telegraphed, the recreation 
wing is stripped, and the new tower from music rom to main building is being formed -- 
the necessary tearing out done. We had to resort to steel members to do this -- some 
are being placed now.  The effect is going to be of a very large building as seen 
from the "hob-back".

The north terrace work is completely poured and will be stripped this week.  The new 
stairway from the terrace to the esplanade provides an unexpectedly good vista from 
the esplanade.

The marble seats and fountain basin on the upper terrace are all at San SImeon and 
setting will begin next week.

We have used up all the columns held in Alameda on the pergola, which has carried it 
about as far as Mr. Rossi's steam shovel had gone before it was requisitioned for the 
Burnette road.

The fire took the nursery at the greenhouse site below "A", which looks so badly, am 
moving the remaining greenhouse items to the new site.

The garden work is progressing smoothly and happily, using the rose man as a temporary 
header up == distinctly not as head gardener.

There were few fruit trees lost, but much planting on the edges, -- olives, redwood, 
sequoias, eucalyptus.  Mr. Keep hopes the rains will bring out#2 -- Mr. Hearst 	August 12, 1930

new growth in many cases.  With Mr. McClenahan, the oak tree specialist -- together 
they have "spotted" a large number of small oaks and laurels down off the Burnette 
road -- Mr. McClenahan's plan being to box, and move immediately to the new site.  
He has been very successful in handling this way.  Mr. Rossi, of course, to provide 
the cranes and trucks -- but no one advises attempting the removal until sure of the 
first rains as water is under normal.

We have been spending more than we should have, but want to average up next month.

The chicken farm construction work to extent agreed, I believe, is done, anyway to the 
extent of the appropriation, plus the fire line which was done at the end.

The Jolon work is progressing well, I will hold back the tower toward the mission 
until you come, as it can be cut off.  The plastering of the interior was done as 
agreed, but the weather has been so very hot, no attempt has been made to plaster 
the exterior.  It will be less expensive anyway to do the exterior plastering as one 
job. Many tourists are mistaking the new building for the Mission, -- it was really 
quite amusing this last visit.  

This I think gives a fair picture of conditions.

Yours very truly,



The ranch people are occupying the kitchen and dining room wing.

Shall Mr. Keep order the necessary replacements for the banks down into the burnt area?  
This is, I know, to come to him through Mr. Parks -- but Mr. Parks thinks a few years 
will make replanting unnecessary
