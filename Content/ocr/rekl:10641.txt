Dear Miss Morgan:

Will you please tell Mr. Keep that the important thing  in the garden is to get flowers that bloom in summer.   We are seldom there in the early spring or in the winter, but we are likely to be there from late spring until late fall.

I have picked out a number of shrubs in the catalogue which seem to be attending to business at our time of year.  there is the abelia grandiflora which blooms continuously all summer.  There tare the acacias which bloom rather early int eh spring, but some of them-- like the nerifolia--bloom most of the time.  Acacias are very pretty trees, however, and we might use some of the others--cyanophylla, decurrens, pravissima, and baileyanna.

I am guessing at  a good many of these plants, and perhaps some of them that I name will not be available if raised without water on the neighboring hillsides.  I should think, however, the buddleia variabilis or butterfly plant might be available.  Mrs. Hearst likes the camellia japonica in various colors.

the carpenteria california or white anemone being a native plant will probably grow on the hillsides without cultivation, as will also ceanothuis thyrsiflorus or California white lilac.

These I think could be planted liberally on the chinese house hill.  The ceretonia siliqua or St. John's Bread should be very useful tree on the ranch, as its pods are good fodder for cattle.  I would like to see these planted liberally in the right places.

The cestrum fasciculatum is a Mexican plant and may do well in our similar climate.  The cestrum parqui is from Chile and is also a promising plant.  It is catalogued as fragrant at night, which is interesting.

The Mexican orange or choisya is a good, useful plant for the hillsides.  Some camphor trees would be interesting.  their leaves are strongly scented and they turn red during winter.

the cistus albidus seems to be a good plant for the hillsides in rocky locations.  Its flowers are lilac pink and it is billed as blooming continuously and being very resistant to drought.

The cotoneaster frigida from the Himalayas flowers well and has beautiful, brilliant scarlet berries.  I should think that would be attractive outside the walls and on the hillsides.

The cotoneaster pannosa from china is also valuable.  I do not know hwether the cotoneaster microphylla is as good as the preceding.  We might experiment with a few.

The cytisus or racemosus is catalogued as in bloom most of the time.  It has pretty yellow flowers and would be very useful for hillside cultivation.

The escallonia is a good one for you.  The montevidensis ought to be useful.  It is very handsome when in bloom.  The erica multiflora grandiflora seems to be the best of the heathers and blooms all summer, according to the catalogue.

I am ensues to get a lot of eucalypti.  The leucoxylon have a long blooming period.  The leucoxylon rosea have a pink flower and are declared to be hardy.

The polythemos are said to be ornamental.  The frudis does not shed its bark and will stand cold.  It should be valuable as windbreaks.

The viminalis I do not know much  about, except that it also resists the frosts and the strong winds and should be chiefly valuable as a windbreak.

The ficifolia is the most generally used of the flowering gums.  The flowers are large and generally crimson or scarlet.

I would like to get all of these in considerable quantities.  Ia m sure they would be useful and beautiful.

I would think the eugenia apiculatat would be good for hedge plants, as they are as compact as box and faster growth and bloom freely.  Eugenia hookeriana are interesting trees.  I would like to have some of those.

The hypericum or gold flower moserianum is billed as blooming continuously.  It needs partial shade, however.  It could be planted under trees.

The lagunaria is said to be something like the hollyhock or hibiscus, but more hardy than the hibiscus.  I am rather fond of hibiscus, but it is rather delicate and may not grow well on our hill.  This lagunaria would take its place.

The letospermum--Australian tea tree--is said to thrive well in California.  The ligustrum jopanicum is said to be  ahandsome flowering tree.  The nandina domestica is beautiful for its berries.  The philadelphus mixicanan evergreen mock orange i s certainly good.  It is very fragrant and in constant bloom.

The pittosporum crassifolium is a shrub which is almost a tree and flowers attractively.  It resist wind and grows well even on the Coast.  The pittosporum rhombifolium is also very attractive on account of its bright orange berries, which last all through the winter.

the pittosporum undulatum flowers prettily and is also fragrant at night, which is to my mind an interesting quality.  The tobira is another, with white flowers and fragrant.
I have already mentioned, the cork oak in a previous letter.

The romneya or Southern California poppy I think should be planted freely on the hillsides if it will grow without cultivation.  

The virburnum ororatissimum may also be interesting.

I think all these shrubs and trees should be bough in considerable quantities and planted freely all over the hills.  The only thing to be careful about is not to plant tree where they will obscure the view when they are full grown.

The shrubs can be planted recklessly--those that will grow without continual watering.  We have not got enough water to waste on hillside cultivation--we must confine it to the garden without the walls.

Of course we can give these shrubs a start with water, but after that they must take care of themselves.

Now in regard to the  conifers--I have several I would like to suggest--the firs, particularly and the concolor and the firma and the nordmanniana, also the pinsapo or Spanish fir.  All these are good for the groves on the bare hill where the reservoir is.

In addition there are the araucaria, idmilli, casuarina, equesetifolia, also the stricta.  Then there are the various cedrus-- the atlantica glauca or blue Mt. Atlas cedar, the deodar and the deodara certicillata.

There are several forms of cypress-- the lawsoniana or Port Oxford cedar, the lawsoniana filifera, the lawsoniana triumph de boskoop, the lawsoniana obtusa ericoides.

The cypresses I am not so crazy about but the arizonica is probably worth planting.  The incense cedar or white cedar decurens I think is a good tree.

The blue spruce are all wonderful-- albacoerulea, excelsa pendula, smithiana, pungens kostriana are all fine.

then of the pines there are the hapepensis, jeffreyi, radiata.

I am coming to the sequoia last of all.  I would like to buy a great number of the sequoia gigantea and the sequoia gigantea pendula-- weeping big tree-- and the sequoia sempervirens, and plant them in the big flat away below house A at the bottom of the hill.

I think we could make  a tremendous grove there of redwoods and big trees which in time would be a marvelous feature, perhaps the most attractive place in the neighborhood.

It is desirable to get tow hundred or three hundred trees of the sequoia in order to cover that flat.  The other 
conifers for the bare hill can be ordered in smaller quantities--from twenty to fifty of each.  

The evergreen shrubs and broad-leaved evergreen trees should be ordered quite liberally so as to have plenty on hand for early spring planting, if that is the best time to plant them.

I should think that most of these, with proper ordering, could be planted most any time of the year.

I do not know whether I said in regard to the bougainvillea that there are two full grown ones to be had at Niles-- growing against an old shed there-- and two or three to be had at the Santa Barbara nursery, in their out of town nursery.

These should be boxed and allowed to live in the boxes for some time before being shipped.  In that way there will be no danger of their dying, as we can plant them in the boxes, and only take out the boxes after they are growing securely.

Also they can be much more safely shipped din boxes, and when shipped, in addition to the boxes they should be carefully wrapped in sacking, so there will be no possibility of the branches being injured as they were in the first shipment.

We must have plenty of bougainvillea.  They are the most decorative of climbing plants and most suitable t the white walls of those Spanish houses.  Wherever we have tried to plant bougainvillea, we should keep planting them until we finally get them growing.  That seems to wind up the plant proposition.

I bought the mantel.  It is really a wonderful one, and we have got to arrange to use it.  This mantel and the tapestries would make any room.

We have such a wonderful Gothic mantel in the refectory that it would be equally splendid to have a renaissance mantel in the assembly room.  It will be carefully packed and shipped.  In the meanwhile, I know you will build  a hall to receive it.

I am also sending photographs of doorframes in marble.  The two larger ones are not in very good condition and still I think could be pieced up to be used if you wanted to use them in the entrance lobby of the big house-- one on either side of the lobby.

the smaller doorframes are in good condition.  I thought they might be use din the dining room-- one on each side of the four entrances-- there are four of these frames in all-- quite handsome.  but too large.

Sincerely,
s/WRHearst
