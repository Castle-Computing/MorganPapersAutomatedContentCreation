CROSS SECTION OF CEILING A MAKES IT SEEM TOO DEEP FOR SMALL AND LOW ROOMS CEILING B. COULD PROBABLY BE MADE SHALLOWER THERE ARE I THINK SUITABLE CEILINGS AMONG THE VARIOUS PAGES SENT YOU KINDLY SELECT SOME OF THOSE AND RETURN SAMPLE PICTURES OF WALLS AND CEILINGS AND I WILL SELECT SOME PLEASE PROCEED WITH YOUR CEILING B MADE SHALLOW FOR ONE SITTING ROOM CEILING HEIGHTS FROM FLOORS SHOULD BE ABOUT ELEVEN FEET DONT YOU THINK.
