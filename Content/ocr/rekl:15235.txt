Miss Julia Morgan.
San Francisco Cal.

Dear Miss Morgan:-

As I wired you, the Copenhagen vases were not found in the barrells we noted.  Mr. Joe Martin says all the vases etc. were photographed before packing.  Why dont you see Mr. Fairchild and look over the photos to ascertain if they were packed?....Let me know if I can be of further service.

Sincerely yours,

s/CC Rossi



[Handwritten note on above letter]

Martin is mistaken about the photos
