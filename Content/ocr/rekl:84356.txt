Dear Mr. Hearst:

It would be possible in three months to raise the main roof, (but not, of course, 
finish it inside or out, put up the new West Tower, refinish the Doges Suite bed 
rooms and baths, the Cloister bed rooms, the new Tower bed rooms, and the Celestial 
bed roms,- by concentrated stead work.

I have been making you a list of the various things discussed and planned for the 
summer and saw all could not very well be done, and perhaps you will go over the list 
in detail Sunday?

At present about 65 percent of budget money goes into grading, trucks with their 
constant repairs and running expenses, bear and lion pits, rock all, fences, meals 
for various garden men, Adams' men, etc., general camp expense and warehousing.  
The balance goes for a little plumbing and electrical work, indoor pool mosaics, cast 
stone for Billiard Room exterior chiefly, a bit for Celestial and basement work, and 
a very microscopic amount into past overdue bills.

Yours very truly,
