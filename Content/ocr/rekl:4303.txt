Dear Mr. Hearst:
As telegraphed today, the painters are putting in 8 hours and Saturday AM. I have impressed upon the the necessity of making more effort if they are to be allowed to finished the work, and it seemed as if they [illegible] the idea.
The lobby of "B" is about done and looks finely, and they have begun work today on the ceiling of the bedroom. The sitting room has not been touched.
The mantel for this room has arrived on top and by a miracle exactly fits in width. It is fine.
A small crew of plasterers was sent up last week and have bedroom ceilings completed of A [completed?]. The window trims of "B" are so very rich, I am afraid it is going to make the trim of your A bedrooms seem meager, Love [illegible] using your [illegible], one for your room and one for Mrs. Hearst's room, an underway. They will [be?] mailed as soon as possible.
The road work shows conspicuous advancement, and the rock top is surely solving the problem. On account of lack of cement the forms in front of "A" and "C" [promises?] finely from C. on account of a heavy storm with fig drifting through the rain, I could not get the effect from the opposite hill.
One thing that surprised me was the comparative warmth indoors without fires. Though extremely strong, not one of the large windows has leaked in the slightest so far, nor has the roof, though the first windstorm made it necessary to get the roofing contractor to weigh down the tile [illegible] [illegible] the [illegible].
It is evidently too early for planting, although the [illegible] in of earth for the [illegible] could be [underway?]
Yours very truly,
overEnclosed is a suggestion for the court of A which occurred to me yesterday as accomplishing two things - making A seem much larger & more important by including all the [illegible] in front of the house in the court, and making the entrance to this court at a point which allows of a bounding wall, not possible before. 
It is what might be called a physiological change, as the material one, is chiefly the addition of the little wall at the ends, the change in the [character?] of the [present?]

Dear Mr Hearst.
As telegraped today the painters are putting in eight hours and Saturday morning. I have impressed upon them the necessity of making more effort if they are to be allowed to finish the work and it seemed as if they grasped the idea.
The lobby of "B" is about done and looks finely, and they have begun work on the ceiling of the last bedroom. The sitting room has not been touched.
The mantel for this room has arrived on top and by a miracle exactly fits in width.
A small crew of plasterers was sent up last week and have bedroom ceilings of "A" completed. The window trims of "B" are so very rich, I am afraid it is going to make the trim of you bedrooms seem meager. Two sketches, using your motifs, one for your room and one for Mrs. Heart's room, are under way. They will be mailed as soon as possible.
The road work shows conspicuous advancement, and the room is surely solving the problem. 
One account of lack of cement the forms in front of "A"and "C" have not yet been filled. The work in front of "C" promises finely. Owing to a heavy storm with fog drifting through the rain, I could not get the effect from the opposite hill.
One think that surprised me was the comparative warmth indoors without fires. Though extremely stormy, not one of the large windows have leaked in the slightest so far, nor has the roof, though the first windstorm made it necessary to get the roofing contractor to weigh down the tile projecting over the cornice.

It is evidently too early for planting though the hauling of earth for the beds could be under way.
Enclosed is a suggestion for the court of "A" which occurred to me yesterday as accomplishing two things - making "A" seem much larger and more important by including all the area in front of the house in the court, and making the entrance to this court at a point which allows of a boundary wall, not possible before. It is what might be called a psychological change, as the material one is chiefly the addition of the little wall at the ends, and the change in the character of the pavement.
Yours very truly,
