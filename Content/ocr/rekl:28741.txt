Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards the road tractor and new 'blade' or plow, - while it would be fine to have them to make a complete road outfit, on inquiring carefully, do not believe they are very much needed before next spring - as would not be used on new terrace work, or for the 'Grand Place' work, or at pool - and Mr. Rossi has not yet been able to arrange through the papers for the much more needed new trucks.  The tractor and blade would cost over $4000.00.

Thank you for the interesting citrus fruit and 'rose' clippings.  I loaned them to Mr. Keep and Mr. Macklen.  Have a new scheme for loan scrap book sheets.

Yours very truly,
