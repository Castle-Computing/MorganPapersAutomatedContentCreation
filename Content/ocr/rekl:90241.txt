Miss Julia Morgan, 
1135 Merchants Exchange Bldg.,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan:

	I have an idea about lighting. 
	
	I have a LOT od lighting in rooms. 
	
	I suggest that we put at least three switches in 
every room. One switch for one set of ceiling lights, the second 
switch for a second set of ceiling lights and the third set for the 
side lights or standards. If we have both side lights and standards 
I suggest four switches. 

	This implies a great deal lot of lights, but Miss Morgan, 
I like LOTS of light. I find almost all of our rooms too dark, -- 
sometimes almost gloomy. I think even the old rooms should in many 
cases be livened up by lighting and abundant lighting. 

	Surely the new rooms should have opportunity for
abundant lighting. 

	It can be so arranged that it need not all be used 
but CAN be used. 

	Sincerely, 
	
	WR Hearst
