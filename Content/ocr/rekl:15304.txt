Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards the Neptune pool --

I have the filter plant similar to that in your University of California Building planned to take care of (by running more or less steadily) the Neptune cascade and pool, the pool below the bay trees, and the "China Hill" pool to be.  We can save some money at a little apparent delay, by taking the quite complicated forms from the University filter down to San Simeon - paying the U.C. contractor a nominal salvage value for them.  May I?  By apparent delay, I mean that it would look at San Simeon as though we were not working on the filter.

As to heating:  I have investigated heating the pool by electricity and find it would not be over expensive as a method, if we had the power --, which we have not.  We have a total service guaranteed of 200 K.W. and it would require 1500 K.W. to heat the deep and shallow Neptune pools.

It has occured to me that as steam likes to travel upwards and the condensation downwards and as distance within limits it has no objection to, it would be feasible to go down the bank on the arroyo side of the road until out of sight and put in a boiler room  down there, piping the steam up hill to the pool.  Would you consider this?

Our largest electric bill so far was that for November, when Hill, Ranch, and Town consumed 60 K.W.  Our average load is 40 - 45 K.W.

You were reimbursed $1258.20 this month by the Midland Counties Public Service Corporation for the first repayment on the

on the cost of the power line. I put the check promptly (as I do all refunds) into the San Simeon Fund.

Yours very truly,
