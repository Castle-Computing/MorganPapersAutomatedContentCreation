Mr. Wm. R. Hearst,
San Francisco Examiner,
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Mr. Hearst;

I have taken up the matter of fencing with Mr. Gillespie, and to enclose the field for the mountain sheep he estimates that it will take approximately a mile and a half of number 9, 6 inch mesh, 7 feet high, park and paddock fencing; and 480 redwood posts, 11 feet high, 6 inches  square, surfaced 4 sides.

Before elk are put in the lower field where the buffalo now are, Mr. Gillespie estimates there will have to be about three and one half miles of fencing.  This will require approximately 1220 posts, 175 of which should be 12 feet high, and the rest 11 feet high.

If this meets with your approval will you please advise me how to proceed.  Will this fencing and these posts be ordered through Miss Morgan's office, or do you want it handled in some other way?

Yours truly,

(Signed) R.A. Addison
