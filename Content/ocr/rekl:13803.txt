Dear Miss Morgan:

I have your telegram in regard to the site for the ranch administration, I see n objection to the tableland below the pine forest near the Van Gordon ranch or it might  be better still to buy the Luchese property and locate the ranch administration in that rich little valley.  

I think this would be the best think and I am advising Mr. Clark to try to do this.

There is no great hurry about it and if we bought this ranch there would not be construction in the way of barns and such outhouses to be built.

In fact the only things necessary would be large commodious and comfortable ranch houses.

I am inclined to think the frame Colonial architecture would be simpler and better.

I will get mirrors for the twelve baths you mentioned and I will get what andirons I can.  I have some in storage and perhaps I can pick up a few others.

I telegraphed you we would not be at the ranch to stay before the first of August, although we may drop in to look at it for a day or two earlier than that.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
