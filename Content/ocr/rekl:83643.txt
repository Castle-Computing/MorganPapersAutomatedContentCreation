Dear Miss Morgan:

I talked with the Otis elevator engineer who is here and he seems to be an unusually 
clever young man.

He says the main trouble with our elevator is its shape.

After considerable discussion, the details of which I need not go into, he declared 
that a circular elevator would avoid most of the trouble that this octagonal elevator 
gets us into.

As one example, let us take the grille doors, which are aggravatingly hard to manage 
even by hand, and which he said would probably be impossible to handle automatically 
by machinery.

The trouble is due to the fact that this sliding grille door has to go around two 
angles.  In a square elevator it goes around one angle.  In a round elevator it would 
not have any angle but merely a gentle and natural curve.

There are other mechanical reasons for preferring around elevator which would probably 
be better explained by the young man himself.

I have concluded to avoid lack of elevator transportation.  It would be well to 
install another elevator in the south tower.

When we do this, we should make that elevator circular, and make the cage very firm 
and free from possible warping.

If we make a perfect job of the circular elevator, we can then remove the octagonal 
one and have that transformed into a circular elevator.

On the circular elevators I would like the automatic door opening device.

If we come to the conclusion that a good elevator cannot be obtained from Otis, 
there is the old-fashioned hydraulic elevator, which is probably the most reliable 
made; but it uses a lot of water-- and we have not much water to spare.

Sincerely,
