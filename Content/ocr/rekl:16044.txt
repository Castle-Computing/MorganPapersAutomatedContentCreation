Dear Mr. Hearst:

After leaving you last night, Mr. Rossi asked me if there was anything more for Mr. Serberoli, the man who finished out the ceiling of the Hall, the Doges Suite bedrooms, and vestibule frieze, - to do.  There is not at present so I let him go.

Coming down it occured to me that perhaps he would be just the man, if you wanted some of those freely rendered wall frescoes for the Beach House. His pay by the day is very reasonable for the work he does.

Thank you for the help on the Hill pay rolls I found here this morning.

Yours very truly,
