Dear Mr. Joy:

Before Miss Morgan was taken ill she had in mind a housekeeper for the ranch.

If you can find out who it was,  I would like to get the housekeeper, as I think that is what the ranch needs.

We have some pretty good people up there, but there is no central authority.

Mr. Rossi is in general charge on the Hill but of course he cannot give much time to the domestic servant situation and probably should not attempt to do so.  I do not know that he is particularly fitted to do it.

Tomkins is not particularly fitten to do it, and moreover the conflict between Tomkins and Rossi is unfortunate, and I think I shall confine Tomkins, when he returns, to his telegraphic work.

Therefore, the housekeeper seems to be the best solution of the situation.

Of  course we must get a competent one, and one who is willing to undergo the inconvenience of the Hill.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
