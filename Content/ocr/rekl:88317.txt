MISS MORGAN:

I have copied this letter to you from Chief-- but am sending the original, 
which is rather informal but which I am sure you will like to have.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I could have allowed two weeks more if it had been suggested.  The reason was 
taxes, which are becoming confiscatory, and will be worse this coming year.

Then we had four places to work on, and in addition a bill at St. Donat's.

However, we can completely finish the Beach House now, and proceed with work at 
San Simeon after the first of the year.

There will be no occasion to resume work at McCloud until May.

I shall not be in California until about the middle of January.  I am delighted 
that everything has gone so well.  The election was not much help, was it?

Sincerely,

W. R. HEARST.
