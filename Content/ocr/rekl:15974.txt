Dear Miss Morgan:

Referring to yours of July 20th, I think the chicken man is rather intelligent and that sometime when you are in Los Angeles you might go with him to see a couple of chicken plants if you have the time.

Of course it is not tremendously important and the matter depends on your time and inclination.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
