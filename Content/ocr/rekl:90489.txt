Dear Mr. Hearst:

	"Slip covers" are practical when of cretonne, linen, etc.,
but they are not practical for materials of silk, heavy wools, etc.

	The "saving" is in being able to send the cover as a whole
to the dry-cleaners. I think your idea of buying enough extra material 
to replace too soied portions of a fixed upholstery is a very good
one, and in the end the most practical, as slip covers look shabby
after a very few cleanings. 

	Attached to and from Mr. Hearst & returned to him
