I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELEGRAPH YOU SUGGESTING THAT BEGONIAS BE KEPT IN SHADY PLACES 
UNDER TREES WHEN I RECEIVED YOUR NOTE AM VERY PLEASED MISS WORN HAS MADE THIS CHANGE 
IN HER PROGRAM THE BEGONIAS ARE GREAT FEATURE UNDER TREES AND I THINK SHOULD BE 
CONFINED TO THOSE SHADY PLACES MOREOVER THERE ARE SO MANY BIG OAKS THAT BEGONIAS 
UNDER THEM WILL BE SUFFICIENT FEATURE WITHOUT HAVING BEGONIAS ELSEWHERE=

W R HEARST.
