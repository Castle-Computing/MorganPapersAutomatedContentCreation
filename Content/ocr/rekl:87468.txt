Miss Julia Morgan,
1135 Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, Calif.

My dear Miss Morgan:

	I called up on my arrival Tuesday
to arrange for an appointment to see you
and learned with regret that you have been
away ill for some time. I sincerely hope
that your recovery will be rapid and that
you will soon be back to the work that you
enjoy so much.

	I spend about a week with Mr.
Hearst on the ranch and how I did enjoy it.
I had not been there for five years and the 
quality of the progress made was a great
pleasure to me, particularly the design
and workmanship in the new additions is
indeed more creditable. I told Mr. Hearst
how admirable everything that was modern
was executed, and the embellishment and
placing of the antiques indeed excellent.

	I have not had the pleasure of
meeting you after so many years of correspondence
and I hope next time I am West,
which will be in the near future, that I
may have the pleasure of calling on you. My 
brother, Robert, who is the designer, met
you a number of years ago and he often recalls
a trip on the freshly made roads on

#2-

Miss Julia Morgan

a rainy November day, with the wheels
of the little Ford simply turning
around and making no headway. The way
he describes this incident was most
amusing. He said while "you were stuck 
in the clay," it seemed to me there were
about 10,000 bulls coming toward the
machine. Those bulls turned out to be
steers and were very gentle, but his
limited knowledge of the ranch forgave
him for that mistake.

	Hoping again that you will be
well soon, and with kindest regards, 
I am

Sincerely yours,
[Michael Frances?]
