December 16, 1923.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I am returning under separate cover, the sketches you sent.

the sketch which puts the GALATEA on the terrace above the pool seems to be too high from the side of the pool, although it is very difficult to imagine the real effect from various angles.

I would think, however, that the sketch which shows the GALATEA lower is the better, as even in this sketch the statue itself is brought by the concrete pedestal and its own marble pedestal up to a level with the terrace, and in this way the statue would be visible from the house a swell as from in front of the pool.

Unless you have reason, therefore, to think that the higher pedestal is better, I will select the lower one as per sketch marked "Accepted W R H."

The only question is whether the additional height makes for an impressiveness, and that I am hardly able to decide.  If you think there is reasonable doubt, perhaps you would better wait until we can make some experiments on the spot.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
