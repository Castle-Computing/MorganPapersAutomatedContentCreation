Dear Miss Morgan:

I would like a polo field made on the lower part of the ranch near San Simeon.

2.  I think this could be combined with a flying field.  I want these made very LARGE and very GOOD and with a small stand for spectators.

The stand need not be grand

3.  I would like a house built at the Burnett, and one at Sanco Pojo-- possibly one at the Burnett.

Shall we prepare economical plans?

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
