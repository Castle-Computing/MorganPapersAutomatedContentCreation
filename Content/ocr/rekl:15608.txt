Dear Mr Hearst:

This is to report that Mr. Keep has a good start on actual bank planting, and enough started ahead to go on steadily with -- it looks very well, - as does the road.

Mr. Rossi's concrete piles and machinery are located where the Nymph Fountain will be, so that no idea of road or development here can be had until the concrete is all poured.

The mantel for the Refectory was a really big piece or work -- they are still on it, but expect to have the scaffolding down next week.  It is certainly twenty-eight feet high this time, and looks it.

The house man  began all right but has been getting lazy.  Will you get a new one south or shall Mr. Fairchild try again here?

The furniture is going into the Doges Suite as best we can think, so that it will be ready for you to suggest on.

Yours very truly,
