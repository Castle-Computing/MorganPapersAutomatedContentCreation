Expect large party including Mayor Malken on ranch immediately after conventions latter part June

Hope we can get terraces cleared up by that time.  I think one body of men should be working on terrace east of A so that can be finished.  Other larger body should finish everything around the pool.  I would like railings and tile on terraces so they will look finished.
