Dear Miss Morgan:

 I wrote you to kindly give the location of the Venus statue with the four well pipes 
 some further consideration.

I did not mean that it should positively go at the end of the bridge over the boiler 
room, but it seemed to me that that was a pretty good place for it, and perhaps the 
best place in case the place where it is now temporarily located is not satisfactory.

I admit that the place where it is now may be the very best possible place; but if the 
lady is to be moved it seems to me that the place over the boiler room at the head of 
the bridge would be extremely good.  sketches great

2.  If we could possibly get linoleum on the upper decks of the beach houses, I would 
like to have it much better than canvas.

Canvas is not very nice and it tracks.  Linoleum looks better and I imagine it could 
be cemented in such a way as to make in impervious.  ? but ansd

3.  Will you kindly look through the books of furniture, of which there are twelve, 
and pick out what we would need for the new rooms at San Simeon, so that when I return 
to San Simeon these new rooms will be completely furnished.

There are a lot of beds, bureaus and other furnishings in the warehouse which I think 
we should use.  They are not doing any good int he warehouse, and some of them are 
very interesting and fine.  ansd

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
