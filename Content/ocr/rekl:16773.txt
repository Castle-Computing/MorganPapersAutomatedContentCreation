February 26, 1927.
Dear Mr. Keep:

In regard to the olenaders -- I think these can be
planted on the south side of the north road except in the low gul-
lies, just as you state. In those lower gullies, I would suggest
planting groups of other trees.

2. I did not know that the pittosporum grew so high.
We must either keep it pruned down or order some of it planted.
Do as you think best about this. It is possible that the dwarf
cassia would be better, although I do not like to see cassia on
both sides of the road.

3. Purple heather we agree upon for the north side
of the north road. Plant it whenever you see fit.

4. There are many kinds of poppies besides the Santa
Barbara poppy and the native California poppy.

Apparently all the poppies like dry soil.

I sent Miss Morgan an article on the various kinds of
poppies from one of the garden magazines. I advise using poppies
in large variety.

5. I have not ordered any deciduous fruit trees. I am
awaiting your list and the number desired.

I have ordered some naval oranges and some olives.

8. It is doubtless better for you to take up with Miss
Morgan the appropriation for extra horses and men. Kindly ex-
plain to her that I have ordered additional orchard space and you
need the additional horses and men to take care of it.

Ask her kindly to make the appropriation required.

Sincerely,
