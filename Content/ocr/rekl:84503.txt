August 6th, 1931

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The 45 foot columns are on the Hill and enough steel beams and trusses to give a 
very official citified Class A effect to work yard the Venetian Court has become 
for the time being.  I think a month will see it in place, but not the concrete slabs 
or walls poured.

The Doges Suite rooms are shaped up and another week or two will have these ready 
for re-furnishing. The new stairways and Gothic baths had to be left in the forms for 
the concrete to set up, and their finish comes next on the program.

In order to get the Main Building back into the habitable state, it was evident two 
weeks ago that all "budget" available of money and people would have to concentrate 
on this part of the program for at least four or five weeks.  As the white bears 
were housed in the new "grotto" and other work at good resting points, this has been 
done. You would realize this if here personally, - with one glance at the steel yard.

The West Tower is coming along nicely - also the finish of the East duplex rooms.  
The garden has been beautiful all summer and the household well managed.

Yours very truly,
