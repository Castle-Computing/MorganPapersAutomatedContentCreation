Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, California

March 21, 1930.

Dear Miss Morgan:

If you approve of the art gallery, I certainly like the idea of the facade as you 
suggest; also of duplicating the design on the two walls of the patio.

I think we can make a finer patio in this way, and I doubt if the east entrance could 
ever be as imposing as what we can make on the north side.


2.  I mentioned the columns for the pergola because I wanted to go ahead with it NOW 
and complete it as far as the gate on the south side, and a corresponding distance on 
the north side. 

Next year we can finish it.

I did not want to cancel the contract nor to use the columns as drains.  I just want to 
make enough pergola to get the planting well started soon.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
