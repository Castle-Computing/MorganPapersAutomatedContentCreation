GOT GILLESPIE TONIGHT.  REPORTS HOUSES IN GOOD SHAPE PALMS AND PLANTING LITTLE DAMAGED BUT NOW THE BLOW THE BIG OAK SO CAREFULLY ALLOWED FOR ON SAN SIMEON SIDE DINING TENTS WENT DOWN IRREPARABLY CONSIDERABLE DAMAGE TO SHRUBS.  HAD TWELVE INCHES RAIN AND HURRICANE WINDS  ROAD IMPASSIBLE BUT GILLESPIE WILL BRING TEAM TO CAMBRIA FOR ME SOON AS DEFINITELY CLEARS.  PERIOD CONSIDERABLE NUMBER WOOD POSTS ALREADY DELIVERED.   THINK SATISFACTORY
