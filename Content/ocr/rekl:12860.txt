Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange,
San Francisco, Cal.

My dear Miss Morgan:

I have been trying to locate the photographs of the fine Spanish ceiling.

I gave Mr. Willicombe all the data - sizes, fullest possible details and descriptions, and am endeavoring to have him locate it.  It is really to valuable to lose and they surely have it in the apartment, and it is the only complete data we have.  We will make a good strong effort to locate it for you at an early date.

I am
Sincerely yours,
s/Mitchel Samuels

Ms/C
