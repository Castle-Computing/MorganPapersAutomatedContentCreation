Mr. W.R. Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed are the drawings and specifications of the detailed pipe line, reservoir and catch basin.  This layout is as you asked, without regard to the usual economies in pipe sizes.

The plan is to use the pipe taken out for extension of the orchard line, etc.

This specification contemplates all galvanized iron pipe.  The tin lined pipe is not made in these  special sizes and would have to be specially ordered.  Cast iron pipe will not stand the pressure, as usually made.

The reservoir is shown covered, with a wire mesh around the sides to keep out "wild life". The cover is to keep the water from evaporating and in better condition as to algae.  The water companies concrete reservoirs are usually made this way.

I hope to be able to send you the final electric report in a few days - the delay has not been from lack of following up.

San Luis Obispo County has had a greater proportional rainfall than the rest of the State, but both garden and orchard had to be watered all winter as strong north winds, following close on each storm, dried out the ground and reduced the benefit to a minimum.

Very truly yours,
JM:G
