Dear Miss Morgan, or Mr. Joy:

I will probably be gone about three months.  I think we have agreed on all of the details of the Wyntoon pool and the Wyntoon tennis courts.  The club house will be postponed until nexy year.  In fact, the tennis courts might be postponed until next year if desired.

I am leaving a check for $5,000 to be added to the $5,000 check already sent.

----

On the ranch here, I understand that Mr. Rossi is to finish the terraces on which he is actually engaged, and then transfer his force to the north wing and the indoor swimming pool.

I have gone over the north wing with Mr. Joy in detail.  We have made a number of rather important alterations, which are marked on the plans.  As far as I recall them they were:

A ladies retiring room and a men's retiring room on the bowling alley floor.  These should be large, as there is plenty of space, and provided with all conveniences.

In the theatre above we are making an orchestra pit which seems perfectly feasible.  We are also widening the proscenium arch in a way which seems quite practicable.

I do not think we should have any windows in the theatre and what appears to be indications of windows can be made into niches on the north wall.

The fire place in the billiard room in being transferred from the north side of the room to the south side, with a door on each side of the fire place, the door on the west side leading to a men's retiring room and the door on the east side leading through an entry into the east room of the main house.  I think this is a much better arrangement and does away with the chimneys on the towers.  These chimneys ruin the towers and I have eliminated them entirely from all the towers except the one kitchen chimney, which cannot be eliminated.

On the first bed room floor there are not many changes, except some minor bath room changes, of which Mr. Joy has notes.  The most important of these is the placing of ample bath room and closet accommodations on the northeast terrace for the bed room at the east end.

By doing this we clear the corridor that runs from west to east on the patio side.  We have made the small tower on the southeast corner an elevator tower and the elevator should open from this tower into this corridor.

On the floor above the second bed room floor we have put a loggia covering a similar corridor with a similar entrance for the elevator and we have added a third room on that floor by the corridor and allowing much more ample closet and toilet accommodations.

We have not disturbed the towers above that floor.

May I say that I think the loggia will be a great success and should be repeated on the south wing, removing the roof there and making an arrangement similar to that of the north wing.  The other tower on the north wing, which contains the stairways, has been raised one story.

The large room on the second floor, west side, we propose making into a studio for the artists and we also propose to have cots available and transform it into a dormitory in case we are ever crowded.

I asked Mr. Joy to provide bath rooms, showers, etc., for this studio.  I think it can be done, especially under the rearrangement.

If there are any minor things that I have not mentioned Mr. Joy has notes of them.

Mr Rossi tells me he is ready to go ahead as soon as the working drawings are finished and I hope the working drawings can be provided by the office without  annoying you with them, as all the important construction points I think have been decided and the reconstruction will not be serious.

In regard to the indoor pool, we have decided on the brilliant blue mosaic small tile and the gilt tile and the border of fishes with gold similar to the beach house.  The walls are to be done in marble in the Roman style and Mr. Joy and I tentatively decided on four statues, one in each corner and two more statues, one on each side of the central door in front of the bridge leading from the large pool to the smaller one. This will make six in all.  I think that is enough and on account of the narrowness of the walk around the pool I do not think we should try to get in more.

Mr. Joy and I thought that on account of the beams in the ceiling the best treatment would be molded plaster in the Roman style in panels between the beams.  We could get in the usual Bacchantes, etc. etc., in relief models in this plaster.

Whether they should be painted or not I do not know.

There is a probability that we should have another statue at the farther end, or say the south end of the smaller pool.  If we cannot find the right thing in a classic statue we can find a modern one.  The water should gush in from the base of this statue.  That would make a pretty effect.

I think the bridge should be in white marble and most of the decorations in white marble.  Mulitcolored marble seems to me more in the Renaissance taste, but you know best about that.

I hope that by concentrating on the north wing and the indoor pool we can get most of those things done by the time I return.

Sincerely yours,

W.R. Hearst
