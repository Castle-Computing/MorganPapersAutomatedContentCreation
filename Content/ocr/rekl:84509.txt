Dear Miss Morgan:

Will it be possible to finish ready for occupancy the two west tower rooms and also the 
two duplexes and the adjoining rooms - five in all - by September first?  

If we can finish and furnish these we will have that many more rooms actually available for the Fall renting season.

I dont know exactly what new construction we will undetake but I would suggest that 
it be no more than raising the roof on the central building so as to make available 
the gothic suite study at as early a date as possible

If we have time for any other out doorwork I would like to open it on the animal department and get our zoo as contemplated 
in shape for the winter  During the winter we can finish the music room and some of 
the other bed rooms in the north wing and also work on the pool and the terraces.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
