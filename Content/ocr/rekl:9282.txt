February 10, 1922.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thinking you may worry about the storm breaking the window of House 2, I would explaining that a scaffolding had been put up in order to set the rosettes in the cast stone balustrade under the big windows.  The storms came up suddenly with such force that eh men came down and in the night a piece of the scaffolding was blown against the window.  While it was the storm, the window, under natural conditions, would have been perfectly safe.

Yours very truly,
