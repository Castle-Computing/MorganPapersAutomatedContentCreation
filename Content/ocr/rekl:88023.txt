Dear Miss Morgan:

We expect to be at the ranch Easter Saturday and Sunday.

Perhaps we can see you there then.

I wish Mr. McClure could go down now and plan for some planting of citrus trees,- 
about one hundred outside the walls and one hundred inside.

I would like to grade down and widen the terrace below the westwall and plant a lot of these trees there in an effective way.  I would like also 
to carry the trees around the corner and along under the north wall up to where the 
wall ends.

Pleasant approaches should be made through the trees to the west stairs and to the 
north stairs.  The west approach should be large enough for horses as well as folks 
on foot.  I do notthink an automobile approach is necessary there.  I suggest that we grade and fill 
and make the approach something like this


Probably Mr. McClure will devise something much better but if he does not some plan 
like the above will do.

I purpose carrying theplanting along the south edge of the road down to the cross roads, also digging 
into the hill to make the road a bit wider and running a wall along the north side 
of the road, I mean of this south road.

We will in due time treat the north branches of the road somewhat similarly.

We have done too much of our planting at long distances from the house.  I purposenow beautifying the immediate neighborhood.

I also want to plant some eucalyptus trees or high conifers as wind breaks and I have 
a FAINT idea that we might plant some canary palms among the oranges on the slopes.  
These would look pretty and tropical and they would protect the oranges to a degree.

Having these various things in mind I thought we should form a workingplan and develop definitely along it.

Inside the grounds I hope to be able to plant a lot of citrus trees on the north 
slopes all the way long in every convenient locality.

There are LOTS of places.

These northern slopes are better protected than the southern slopes.  They get the 
north winds but the north winds are not so severe.

Furthermore some wind breaks might occasionally be provided.I thought we might plant camelias in among the oranges on these north slopes.

They would be pretty and the orange trees would shade them.

The pomegranates I would like to plant along the bases of the INSIDE north walls to 
grow right against the walls or very near them.

Perhaps we might dig away a strip of flooring and get down to the earth next these 
walls.

You remember thepomegranates used to be lovely in similar localities.

3-  Miss Morgan.

I have some passion fruit to scatter among them.  This fruit climbs the walls.

I think these fruits will not only be lovely but easy to take care of.  We can not 
have too big a flower garden.  It takes too much attention.

Of course all this has to be carefully thought out but these are the outlines.

Sincerely,

s/ W R HEARST I hope you admire the stationery.  The newspaper pad is my own.  The elegant envelope 
 I stole from the hotel at Hauheim.  On second thought I think the bill was enough to 
 pay for it.  W.R.
