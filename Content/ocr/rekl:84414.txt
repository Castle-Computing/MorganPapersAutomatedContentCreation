Dear Miss Morgan:

Referring to the following telegram received by Mr. Acton from McGregor and relayed to me--

SAN DIEGO MUSEUM OF FINE ARTS WILL SHIP A PAIR OF PORTRAITS TO MR. HEARST AT SAN SIMEON.  KINDLY INSTRUCT WHOEVER RECEIVES THEM IN THE WAREHOUSE AND CALL THEM TO MR. HEARST'S ATTENTION AFTER THEY ARRIVE,--

Mr. Hearst instructs me to ask you to please try to hang these portraits, as they are attractive and decorative and he thinks also 'we ought to get as many things out of the warehouse and in the building as possible.'

2.  For your information, Mr. Hearst has instructed me to tell Mr. Rossi that he may have-- as a gift or bonus-- the Studebaker car that he has been using; but that this does not affect any of the other cars or his ruling regarding them and automobiles on the hill generally, as per your recent correspondence.  Enclosed is copy of letter to Rossi.

Sincerely,

s/ J Willicombe
