Mr. John Francis eylan,
901 Crocker First National Bank Bldg.,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Mr. Neylan:

	Referring to your letter of June 27th,
of course the lamps and standards which Miss Morgan 
reffered to are art objects. The fact that an object of 
art may be used for a utlitarian purpose does not
prevent it from being an object of art. The wonderful
lamp in the Cathedral at Pisa is none the less an object
of art because it is a lamp.

	I do not know who to get in San Francisco
to testify to the artistic character of these lamps, but
anybody who knows could and would so testify. I would think
that artists, art dealer and art writers and experts would 
so testify. Miss Morgan ought to know who the proper people
are.

	Sincerely yours,
	
	W.R.HEARST(H)
