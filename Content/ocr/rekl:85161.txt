Dear Miss Morgan:

The Soverignceil 103 feet long should form the central motif for our proposed great 
hall at San Simeon.  The ceiling is narrow, - only 20 feet but I think it could be set 
in the middle of a frame.

There is also a possibility of using one of the high Moorish style ceilings in the 
middle of the hall and dividing this to go at each end.

The ceiling for the middle might be the one with the tiles in it. That would be showy 
and effective.

The ceiling is our great problem.  The other matters will be easy to solve.

I am sending with this photos of Soverignceil and also some drawings and photos of 
groined ceilings at Alcantara.  Did we order the cloister ceilings there?  I think
 we should.

Did we get gargoyles?  How many.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
