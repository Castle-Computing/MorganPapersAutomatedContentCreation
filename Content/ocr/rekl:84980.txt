Dear Miss Morgan:

During the month of December we lost eleven of our best animals,

2	Waterbucks
1	Sable antelope
1 	Kudu
1	Ibex
2	Blesbok
1	Sambar
1	Blackbuck
1	Oryx (baby)
1	Nylgau

I would say they represented something like $8,000 or $10,000 in value.  They were 
lost through exposure in heavy storms.

Mr. Baldwin said that these losses occurred in spite of the best efforts of himself and 
staff to save these animals and that others would have been lost except for vigorous 
efforts.

He said we need more shelters and some pens.

I would say that we need not only more shelters but shelters that are a little more 
protective.

I think the pens can be in connection with these shelters and I think the shelters 
should be more in the nature of barns than merely open shelters or protective fences.

If we are going to lose $10,000 worth of animals a winter - and we may lose more than 
that - we can well afford to put up more shelters and the kind which will protect the 
animals and keep them warm as well as dry.

I advise, therefore, first, that we alter our present shelters and make them larger 
and very much more protective.

Second, that we build about two more shelters for the smaller animals in the upper 
field and one in the lower field for the larger animals.Miss Morgan - 2.
Of course the buffalo do not need protection much, but there will be certain animals 
turned in with the buffalo in that lower field which may need protection.  Therefore a 
good big shelter should be provided in the lower field.

I do not think we need any general heat, but I think that it would be well to have in 
connection with two or three of these shelters a room with a fireplace where sick a
nimals could be taken and attended to.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
