Dear Mr. Hearst:

There are still here in Stringer's warehouse vault two tapestries - from Wyntoon, - 
one a Chateau and Garden subject similar to the one now hanging behind the beds in the 
Della Robbia Room - the other a landscape with a fantastic Temple subject, much smaller.

Unless the mate to the "Faun" tapestry was shipped directly to Mr. Williams, it is not 
here.  Mr. Williams sends faithfully notices of shipments received, but his descriptions 
of articles do not always make them recognizable.

Enclosed is an up to date list of your tapestries out here, and their present 
whereabouts.

Yours very truly,
