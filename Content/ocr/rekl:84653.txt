December 3, 1931

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As what we could do on the indoor pool, dressing rooms, 
etc. would not count much in a week, I have asked Mr. 
Rossi to concentrate on covering in at the Celestial 
bridge, completing the west Celestial stairway and 
suite so it may be used, closing in the end of the new 
study, and putting up as much pergola as he can in a 
week or ten days.

It will be necessary also to put on asphalt and felt
 roofing on the Main Building before leaving it, as it 
 can not be flashed otherwise, and leaks will develop 
 where the newly poured work connects with the old.

I asked Mr. Rossi to let the men off as their work 
reached good stopping places.

Yours truly,
