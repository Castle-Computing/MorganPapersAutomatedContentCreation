Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards help on the Hill, the second man seems to be willing and obliging and Anna is at work training him.  My impression is he is likely to be honest.

There seems to be a dearth of good butlers here.  The only one who seems promising was with Mrs. C.B. Spreckles and Mr. Weil and in both cases was satisfactory.  They have left closing their houses.  I am saving his name for you in case you find later you want to investigate him.

The household conditions on the Hill are very much improved.

Yours very truly,
