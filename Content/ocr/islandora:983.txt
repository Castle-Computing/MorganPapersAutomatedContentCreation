Miss Julia Morgan,
Architect,
Merchants Exchange Bdg.,
San Francisco, California.

My Dear Miss Morgan:

I am mailing you under separate cover by registered mail some pictures, and a book on architecture in Spain which I picked up.

The immediate thing of value is on page eighty-four.  The treatment of the roof beams, the cornice and the tile frieze seems to me very interesting and effective, and very characteristically Spanish.

 I think we could apply it to our cottages and give them a little more dignity and at the same time more distinctiveness.

There is a little suggestion of the Moorish in it which I think is appropriate for this kind of architecture.

Will you please make an adaptation of this?  I feel sure it will be very decorative and effective.

The kind of projecting roof on page seventy-two is a little more usual, but I think might be available for the roof of the big building when we come to construct it.

The suggestion on page sixty-four is for use on the big building also; likewise the Gothic doorway on page forty-nine.  I do no know that this Gothic doorway is altogether available, but it would certainly go very well with the bell towers if we made them after the style of the church at Ronda, with those Gothic pinnacles which you made in one of your drawings.

The Gothic and Renaissance of Spain are so very much more interesting than the Baroc stuff of the Eighteenth Century.  The iron work of your windows is already Renaissance, the first big hall of the big building will be in Renaissance style, and on the whole I do not think it will be bad to have such a Gothic doorway as this Seville one, and the Gothic pinnacle towers of the Ronda church of Santa Maria.

That, however, is in the future, and I will have time to talk with you about it.

I am shipping you marble columns for the entrance porches of the little cottages, and also some marble and faience pieces for the decoration of these entrances.

I think in my cottage I will make the entrance

porch a lobby, enclosed, because I may sometimes be there in winter and it would be well to have an enclosed porch of this kind.

In the same way I think we should build out in front of the main building-- when we build it-- a lobby about 26 or 28 feet wide and 8 feet deep, with  a big entrance door, and with coat closets on each side so that the actual entrance would not probably be more than 12 or 14 feet.

I think if we were to use the thing at all in winter a lobby of this kind is necessary to keep the cold out.  But in the summer these outside doors can be kept open so that there will practically be only the doors into the hall itself  remaining.

If we do this I think the central part of the roof above should be advanced similarly 8 feet.  I will try to make a little drawing of what I mean.

I do not know whether I wrote asking that the surfaces of these houses be made smooth like Keene cement or plaster rather than rough like stucco or concrete. This applies particularly to the outside surfaces.  On the inside we might have that same smooth surface or else a caenstone effect.

My idea of the assembly room in the big house would be something like the Stanford White decorations marked B and C, only probably with plain walls as in A and D.

These are, of course, a little over elaborate, but I think we should have a rich gold and polychrome ceiling and rich door frames, mantels, etc. against simple wall surfaces, either imitation caenstone or a solid color material, like a red velvet.

I am afraid of material down there, too, lest the rats eat it up;  but perhaps with real houses rats would not get in so much.

The sketch marked E has a similar treatment.  A, B, C, D, and E are all examples of it.

The letter F is the much more severe style that I thought we might use for the refectory.  This room I think should be enriched, though, with the balconies as you have planned it, and also with paneling running around it about the height of the balcony, with a shelf on top for decorative objects, as in picture G.

There will also be the choir stalls and the sideboard in this room, and some tapestries to hang on the upper surfaces of the bare walls.

The picture H is still more sever, and would do for the rear lobby or trophy room as we have it marked.  It has a good floor for muddy boots and a good wall surface to hang guns, etc.

3. 

Plate I is my idea of the treatment of the eight small bedrooms on the roof of the main building.

I am sending along, too, a little picture marked K, which has a suggestion for the outside staircase of my cottage, which staircase would run down from the terrace to the storeroom below.

Of course, all these things are just thoughts, and if you do not like them we will not try to follow them.  In any case we would not follow them exactly but merely approximately.  My purpose is simply to convey to you a general idea of the decoration I think would be fitting, so that when you are working you will be working somewhat along those lines.

Kindly return these pictures after you are through with them.

The stuff I am sending to San Simeon is carefully marked on each case, and with each case also bearing the sale catalogue number of the article.  I am forwarding you the sales catalogues under separate cover.  They will contain the numbers and pretty elaborate descriptions of the articles, so that you can read exactly what they are and only open such cases as you need and as you need them.

The catalogues are lettered to distinguish them, and the number on the case will be preceded by the right letter.

I have heard  nothing from Mr. Peck.  I wish, therefore, unless some objection arises, that you would go ahead with the location of the cottages as  I marked them on the contour map.

In fact, I would not be disposed to change them anyhow, even at Mr. Peck's suggestion, unless he gave some very practical reason for doing so, as his mere preference might not be any better than anyone's else.

If what I have written from time to time is not clear, and you want any further attempt to elucidate, will you kindly let me know and I will try to write in more detail.

Sincerely yours, 
s/ WR Hearst
