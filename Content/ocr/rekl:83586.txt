Mr. William Randolph Hearst, 
C/o Los Angeles Examiner,
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr. Hearst,-
	The first shipment of lames, the ones now at San Simeon, were entered under a duty 
of 20 percent. This we paid, but upon examination by the Customs' inspectors they held
that the duty should be 50 percent. Under the American Express Company's bond the 
shipment was release and a protest was filed by the Express Company.

	The entry has now meen liquidated by the Express Company, and they have billed us
for the additional 30 percent duty.- $694.20. as shown by the invoice attached. We will 
have to reimburse the Express Company within the next seven of eight days.

	Shall we turn over to Mr. Neylan's office the handling of these cases, as we did in
previous Customs cases?

	Very truly yours,
