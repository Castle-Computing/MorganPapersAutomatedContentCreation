Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr.Hearst has okeyed monthly appropriation of $15, 000.00 for ranch work for eight 
months beginning this month.  You will receive check for $15,000 less the $2,500 
over-paid in February.  Is this satisfactory?

For Wyntoon, M.Hearst has reduced the monthly appropriation from $12,500 to $10,000 
beginning May 1st, for a period of eight months.

Both at ranch and Wyntoon the appropriations are for six months work and two months 
additional to clear up accumulated accounts.

Best wishes,

Sincerely yours,
s/J Willicombe
