Dear Miss Morgan:

This is memorandum of the planting we discussed.

1. The hill above the garage conifers.  Also redwoods and big trees (Sequoia Sempervirens and Gigantes.  You see I'm learning ‘em) on flats below A.  I have shown these flats to Mr. Hazzard.

2. Orange trees -- Seedless Oranges and Valencia or Summer Oranges on the bath house hill and slope; also in front of A, and also in front of C.  Mandarins, etc. can be included in this planting.  I think oranges will bear on these hills if protected places are found.  They are agreeable trees near the houses and will not grow big enough to cut off the view.

3. Beyond the orange trees in hollows and lower down the slopes plant fig trees.  These trees grow big and must not be too near the houses.

4.  Beginning with the corral hollow and extending over the hills beyond to the West plant the deciduous orchard -- cherries -- apricots -- peaches -- nectarines -- plums -- pears -- apples, etc.

5. To the south of this, following the road down towards the watering trough, nuts, olives, etc.

I understand it is well to plant mulberries with the cherries as the birds prefer them to the cherries and leave the cherries alone.

Also the chickens like mulberries, so perhaps some mulberry trees around the farm, which will be on the flat in the middle of the deciduous orchard.

I am told chickens also like hollyhock seeds.  Therefore hollyhocks come around the farm, both for beauty and for use.  You see I am catering to the chickens.

6. Grapes I think should be planted from the terrace in front of B East, between the two roads toward the garage circle.  Also some grapes should be planted outside the wall on the northern sides.  Blackberries, raspberries, loganberries, etc. can also be planted to grow over the wall and over arbors.  Perhaps we can have pergolas somewhere.   In fact I think a pergola here and there in a place fitted for it would really be better than a continuous line of pergolas.

7. On the sunny side of the wall -- the south side -- we should have trained fruit trees, fan shaped, etc.  The fruit 
from such trees is particularly fine and I have ordered trees of this kind and arranged for a man from Niles to come down and train ‘em.  I have also ordered some fruit trees in pots to use on the terraces.  We can put them in the hot houses in winter if need be.

8.  I think we  should plant some big stretches of red Christmas bearing plants in proper places outside the walls and perhaps in some places against the wall, but I don't want to crowd the fruit trees, grapes and edible berries away from the wall.

 I think patches of Christmas berries would be good on outside slopes.

9. Heather - broom - and drought resistant stuff we might plant along the road.  That's all for outside.

Inside the wall I have not gone into great detail.  

Of course I would like Bourganvilla in front of A to climb up the walls of the upper terraces and have planted vines there.  If these don't grow, other vines can be had full grown at Niles and Santa Barbara, and can be transplanted and transported with more care.

In the shady places where climbing vines are used, fuchsias and honeysuckles are good.  I suggest another honeysuckle in the court of A where it is shady.

Climbing roses in appropriate colors should be used liberally on all the houses.  They are particularly lovely and will make wonderful displays on the sides facing the central plaza.  We have lots of other fine climbing vines.

Over the wall enclosing the central plaza the plan for ivy geraniums and roses is excellent.  I have advised sweet peas on trellises back of these.  This treatment should continue all the way around this plaza wall.  THere is sufficient variation in the coloring of the different roses and sweet peas, and there is a connecting hue in the ivy geraniums.

The court of B is pretty as it is with the heliotrope, etc.  I have put the cactus there.  It is the warmest and most protected court and the most delicate things will do best there.

Hibiscus might be planted in the plots in front of B, near where the palms are planted.  I think they will still be protected and as Hibiscus grows pretty large it will have to be kept away from the courts and the sides of the houses.

On the west side of B is a shaded place good for rhododendrums, tree ferns, etc.  On the east side of B there is sun and large plots for shrubs, etc.  The hibiscus would be well there 
unless the north wind would kill it.  On the north of C is a good place for fuchsias, honeysuckles and other plants that like shade, and on the south of C Bouganvilles and semi-tropical vines and shrubs.  There is a large planting area here, and down towards the wall we might plant some flowering trees.

Perhaps a pergola could go in here somewhere, or a bit of a cloister if I can find one.  Sounds like we were going to plant it, but I don't mean that.

We should have some Japanese flowering shrubs somewhere, and I suggest some camellias for the nice shady court of A.

In the court of C I would like to get something suggesting southern Spain, but I don't exactly know what.  On the tops of the little wall opposite the inner windows of C I think violets, blue and white, -- pansies, and such short flowers as they will be lifted up thy the walls so that they can be see; and furthermore, they will not grow high enough to hide the jars.   

Below C on the west terraces I suggest very colorful flowers and shrubs, like oleanders, purple anemones, etc. -- things which make masses of color to be seen from the road.

Roses could climb up the bare walls -- yellow and red roses -- perhaps persian flowers.  I have asked Mr. hazzard to use only two cypress on each side, and to plant them with the big pilaster or buttress between them.  Up these buttresses we can run climbing roses.

This seems to take care of most everything in a general way, except the central plaza.  I suggest box for the semi-circular  hedge there with the eight lighting standards between.  Thus :

For the rest flowering shrubs and trees and some of that low spreading cypress.  The central plaza will take some thought.  It will be helped by the Three Graces and perhaps some other statuary.  It should be rather formal and should constitute the special garden of the big house.  I think some roses would be well here.
The rose garden we have planned out together.  The butterfly in the center to be masses of low flowers -- not roses.

The roses to surround the garden.

Perhaps pergolas on each side of the butterfly, thus:

On all the big beds of shrubs there will be four foot border of English flowers.  Also English flowers, annuals and perennial, in the shallow beds along side the house fronts, etc.  There are also to be rock borders along some of the paths with rock plants.

Let's try to get quite a variety of flowering cacti of the sumptuous kind; also another Yucca plant or two; but let's not make an Arizona garden.  THey are uninteresting.

I am still anxious to get acacias, jacarandas, magnolias, and other flowering trees where we don't want to do much gardening, -- say up towards the garage and around the patio, and in large spaces.

The flowering Eucalyptus should , I think, go along the road in places, as we come up from the watering trough.  So should the various oaks, etc.

I guess that's all for today.  Please excuse writing.  THe train is wiggling.

Sincerely, 
s/ W.R. Hearst
