Dear Mr. Hearst:

		We will have the light outlets 
controlled by the system of switches you outline. 
There are many wall outlets, all double, in each 
room. The Spanish lanterns do not hold many or 
large bulbs as a rule, without looking strange. 
How would you like some kind of a reflector such 
as used for the Leusterweibehen at Wyntoon --
one switch for this, one for the lanter proper, 
one for the standards, and one for any mantel or 
special side lights?

Very truly yours, 
JM:F

Dear Miss Morgan - I don't think the reflectors would be good 
- except for the Leusterweibehen at Wyntoon.  I don't greatly like
them there but there seem the only thing possible to do and ?
the Leusterweibehen unharmed. 
	Have it as different. We can have secondary lamps etc
