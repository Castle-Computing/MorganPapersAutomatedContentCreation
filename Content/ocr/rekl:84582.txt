Mr. William Randolph Hearst, 
La Cuesta Encantada
San Simeon, California


November 9th, 1931

Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.  The only silver candlesticks received this summer are those reported to you last 
night as being used in the Cloister rooms, the twins' room, and one small pair 
reserved for the deck room.

2.  The Roman plunge is taking shape.  Do you still think it best to take out the 
wide pilaster in the main plunge room?  I do not wish to be insistent, but just sure.

3.  In regard to the replacement of the San Simeon private telephone poles, do you 
want Mr. Gillespie back?  He does not seem to be on any of your pay rolls at present 
and will need a "heading up" to get the material, use of equipment, etc. needed.  
I was negligent in not asking yesterday, as some poles need prompt attention.

As always,

Yours very truly,
