August 29, 1927.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed are photographs of the two Madonnas of which we spoke last night.

I find that we called Mr. McGregor's attention to the first break on June 8th, but that through delay in my own office the Madonna was only returned last week.  Mr. McGregor's response was- 'Please send both bas reliefs that have been broken back here.  I will investigate thoroughly and demand payment in full from the packers.'

In repacking every broken piece was separately wrapped and packed.

Yours very truly,

P.S.  We have no photograph of the second Madonna here except in a catalogue.  It was attributed to Della Quercia.  You purchased it in 1927 at a Canessa Sale and it was received here in the 28th car, about 1927 (August) but not opened until needed this spring.
