Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Solon is wonderfull as a designer and colorist, but he slows up the work tremendously by 
continual changes in the scheme and program.

The result will be that we will not get the pool ready if we do not adopt some other policy 
than the one now prevailing.

We have been an extremely long time on the ceiling of the living room of the celestial suite.
  We are not making headway because we are putting another man to go ahead with it.

The design is settled and satisfactory.  I am going to take the liberty of insisting that it 
be unchanged.

I think we will have to adopt the same policy in regard to the pool.

Let us get a set and satisfactory design and color scheme, and then put in artistic workmen
 to carry it out.

Mr. Solon will be valuable if he does not interfere.

If he does, I would suggest, Miss Morgan, that you find meed for him in San Francisco.

I would like to see the pool ready on the date promised.

I am sure it will not be ready unless we proceed in a more practical manner.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
