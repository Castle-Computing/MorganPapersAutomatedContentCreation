Mr. James A. Murray,
New York American,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Murray:

Thank you for the letter regarding the Fourteenth Carload.

As the shipment is only unpacked as needed, sometimes in San Francisco, sometimes at San Simeon, it will be possible to report on the general appearance of the cases, etc. but not on the condition of articles.  To really know and report on, it would be necessary to open all boxes.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
