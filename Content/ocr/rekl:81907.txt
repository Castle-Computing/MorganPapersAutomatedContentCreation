Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards the note on tapestries --

We will plan to take down the San Simeon tapestries twice a year.  There are two 
tapestries at Wyntoon, not lined, and all showed the effect of long hanging.  We 
cleaned and rolled and hung in a new way, but think it would be a good plan to take 
all down now that the dampness is out of the building, roll and keep in the refectory 
( a warm room) until just before guests go up.  If you approve, I shall be glad to take
 care of this.

Yours very truly,
