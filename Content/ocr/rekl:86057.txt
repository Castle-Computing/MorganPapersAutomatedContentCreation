Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, California

Dec. 3, 1932.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have your letter enclosing one from Mr. N. Bronson Williams.  I do not know whether 
Mr. Williams is a dealer or not.  If he is not a dealer, I will simply return the 
photographs as unavailable.  Please let me know.

If he is a dealer, I would like to tell him that some of the things are fairly good 
from a decorative standpoint, but are priced out of all reason.

Mr. Williams speaks of the pictures as South American Primitives.  Of course they are 
not primitives at all, in the accepted sense of the word.

They could not be used at San Simeon, but might be used at the ranch house at Milpitas 
if Mr. Williams would come down to earth in the matter of prices.

The most useful in those large rooms would seem to be the four Saints, No. 18, San 
Joachim, Santa Anna, Etc.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco.
