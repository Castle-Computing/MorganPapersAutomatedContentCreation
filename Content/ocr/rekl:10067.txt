Mr. William randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive.
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I.  The Niles Nursery Co. relented on hearing of Hazard's departure, and agree to send the redwoods you selected.  Nigel Keep saw them in February and reports them well boxed and ready to move.

II.  The plowing of the orchards, digging around the trees individually, heightening the temporary fences (not respected by the deer), etc. has taken most of the labor the last moth, with only two men on the garden space.  I have ordered a let up on the orchard work and a PORTION OF the garden work in the space within  the walls.  No attempt has ben made to move the palm and widen the path in front of C, as the palm probably would not survive it.  It has growth coming out of its head like a new baby's hair.

III.  As to the status of other work:  There is much pavement and stone setting work to do.  The balustrades for below A are cast and are nearly hard enough to set up.  Hadly, his son and man Friday, will be needed for some time for this work, setting of your marbles, etc.  I think Washburn could be dispensed within a month at most, as the running of fences, orchard, etc. work and men needed for it, could be handled by Gillespie, or if you want to let him go, by a labor foreman.  I would like Washburn to get in the rough concrete below B before going.

IV.  Van Der Loo has certainly worked indefatigably this winter with an excellent 
crew.  No money has been wasted, given what had to be produced.  The first trims are up[, and the others will follow steadily as soon as dry, all being underway in Oakland.  The lower bedroom with the "shield" ceiling looks so well without the columns, you may wish to omit them.  There has been more decorative work on the new A rooms than in B and c combined as no ceiling, frieze, and trim is duplicated.

Humrich's work on the ceilings looks promising.

V.  In the sitting room of A would you think it interesting to make the little figures on the overdoors a set of apostles,--or just suggestive of prophets?  There will be sixteen needed.  Two antiques are right in size, (four if present pedestals were not on).

At the entrance door a pair of "grape vine" twisted columns, while a little light weight, will work I think by adding a heavy member to the capital.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
