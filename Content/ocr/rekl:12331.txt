Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I have taken the question of the "divan" or "couch" for Mrs. Hearst's front room up with the makers and am sending you with this sketches as I do not want to risk it not being right.

As there is so much old gold tone in the walls would Mrs. Hearst care to bring out blues in coverings -- blue with a bit of silver and old gold, perhaps.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM

P.S.  Attached letter gives sizes of chair and couch seats, House B,
