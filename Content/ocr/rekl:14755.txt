Dear Miss Morgan:

I agree with you it is best to have the drawing of the refectory with the mantel in, but it does seem that the mantel is so perfectly suited to it that we are likely to use it.

And these big mantels seem enormously impressive.  Everybody is wild about the big mantel in the living room.  If we can give them an even more wonderful one in the refectory I think it will be worth while.

Sincerely Yours,

s/W.R. Hearst
