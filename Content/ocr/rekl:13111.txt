Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Sunday was spent at San Simeon with Mr. McCoughern of the Board of Underwriters and their chief engineer.  They advise very strongly, even with the present supply in sight, to install the new pipe from the reservoir of 6"and then 4" galvanized pipe rather than the 5", 3" and 2" proposed and to carry it around the esplanade with permanently located fire hose on either side.  This with the two auxiliary tanks in the Main Building towers, they think would give fullest protection for any possible fire from outside or inside source.  We have held up the order for the pipe until you pass judgment on this recommendation.

The furniture is moved out of the small bed rooms of houses B and C, and walls, openings, etc. are being carefully covered so as to guard against damage while the new bath rooms are under way.

The plumbers are making good progress on the Main Building.

The water analysis shows that the trouble with your San Simeon water is that it is too pure -- equal about to distilled water,   The result of which is that it is eager and anxious to be otherwise, and give sup its oxygen freely to make iron oxide out of the pipe.  There are no chemical deposits other than this in the filled up pipes.  It is a great life, is it not?  As a result, it would look as though with galvanized pipe for the main lines and brass pipe for the water lines inside the Main Building, as good a solution as possible would be attained.

We have been having the usual September very hot spell on the Hill, while all is fog and wrecks on the shore.  On the visit ten days ago, Mr. Keep proudly presented the first ripe grapes -- this Mr. Greenbro tells me is a month ahead of the ripening of the grapes down at the ranch house.  This week there are lots of grapes.  There are also three avocados nearly ripe on lower A terrace!
The concrete beams and slabs are poured over the library and back to the line of the small bed rooms -- with prospect of getting the side walls poured up to the top of the galleries this week.  The steel beams for the storage floor are ready to be shipped to-morrow, but it is doubtful if the boat will take them on account of the tides.  You will remember we had trouble with shipments last year after the Chile earthquakes.  the difficultly is not apparent to the eye as the surf is about as usual.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
