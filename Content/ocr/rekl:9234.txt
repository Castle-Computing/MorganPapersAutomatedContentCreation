Dear Miss Morgan:

Two large tapestries and a set of four somewhat smaller tapestries were sent from the Hacienda to the Ranch.  

They are the Ranch House in case and probably being sufficiently well cared for;  but I have a feeling they would be sager in the storehouse at the Hacienda.  We have now made that a fireproof building.

Will you kindly have Mr. Kinkaid go down to the Ranch and pick out these tapestries and bring them back to the Hacienda and store them there?

Sincerely, 
s/ WR Hearst
