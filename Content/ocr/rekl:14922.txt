Dear Mr. Hearst:

Our surveyor says he thinks the accompanying print shows all the rocks whose condition is safe to count upon as a foundation.

High tide covers them by three or four  feet, not counting the actual breakers which are ordinarily two to six feet high - possibly much higher in a real winter storm.

Yours very truly,
