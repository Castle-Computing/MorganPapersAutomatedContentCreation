Ritz Tower

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	Not knowing just the emergency limits, also knowing 
we were running over the immediate budget on material bills, 
on receipt of your cable, I cut down all except a very few 
maintenance people on the Hill. However, would you consider 
putting back John van der Loo and a helper on the cast stone 
to work steadily through the winter as was done last year - 
as otherwise we will be without material to work with in the 
spring, and also so as not to lose him, his two best men 
having already left for the Argentine, and he getting restive, 

	Also, would you approve putting Mr. Georgy back on 
part time to work on nothing but lanterns. When the camp is 
active, he is always called off this work, no matter how often 
I get him to start, and many of the lanters need immediate 
attention, 

OK 
OK
Put'em back
OK

	Also, the tapestries need attention, and the Gomeses 
were let out with the rest.

	Mr. Williams' warehouse crew will all be needed - as 
long as shipments are to be made. 

	It will be necessary to find different basis for 
George Loorz's work, to keep him, and this I would like to 
talk over with you. It can wait your return. 

	I expect to be in New York a few days onn personal 
matters sometime this winter - if before you leave will let
you know. 

	As always, 
		Julia Morgan 
		
Will be her until Jan 1st

I think it would be well to have
Mr. Looez can general construction
head and let him direct work at 
San Simeon Wyntoon Grand Canyon
