Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Bogart has given me your instructions in regard to the cutting off work at the camp.  As you know, this was already done at Christmas as regards the main building work -- But enough labor was engaged after the holidays to go on with the planting, fencing about plantings in animal enclosure and on Spring Hill, etc., walks, terracing, etc., trucking of material for this, and providing for some work on the roads.

To do this work effectively we figured there would be needed --

No. of men
  1 Rossi
13 Keep, Web and eleven men between them
 4 For rock and paths and pavements
 5 For fences, plowing and roads Gillespie and four men
 2 Drivers for teams or trucks
 2 Cook and helper
   There are also -- as to camp expenses 
 2 Robert and Tompkins
 1 Divet on furniture and carpeting

Total 30 men

You can judge from his list the extent you wish to cut the force.  I think as before explained, that Gillespie would  be better for a vacation an Rossi could do his work for the winter in addition to general supervision.  Or, I would gladly take Rossi back in the office.

We will have to meet on back orders, material ordered but not delivered yet for the Main

Building, etc. a total of not over twenty thousand dollars.  This will naturally spread over some months.

There is one other case especially needing your decision: Mr. Vander Loo Sr. came to me in December early with an offer he had received of a two year contract on fine terms for a very interesting piece of work in the south and wanted to know if we would want him and his son or not as he had to give his answer.  I told him "yes, certainly, we would need him", and that we could start the Main Building models in January, as it would be necessary to have some months start over the other trades in order to get the models ready and the stone cured.  If we let him go it will be difficult to replace him in quality at anything like what we pay him.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
