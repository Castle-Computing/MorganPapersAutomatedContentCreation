Dear Miss Morgan:

As I telegraphed, I am disposed to think that the model of the terrace of A which we looked over in San francisco is better than the drawn plan that you sent me and which I return herewith.  My reason for thinking so is that the model was based on our survey of the ground; and, if you remember, the ground there is a little more level on each side and very steep in the middle.

The drawn plan shows a semicircular bulge or bat in the middle.  I remember you said that you had to go down in that particular point about as much as you went out; that is to say, that the angle was about 45 degrees.

That makes any projection at this point pretty expensive construction and necessarily rests it on a very high front wall.  Therefore, it seems to me that the construction should not project in the center but should project at each side.  I have modified your drawings in accordance with this idea.

I think those square platforms on each side can be made very attractive and made big enough to be really useful.  Moreover, after thinking about it I believe that the most effective treatment for them would be to have a fountain in the center of each, this fountain to consist of a raised basin on a foot or stem and containing a little pool of water, and this to be surmounted again by a statue.

I remember we saw in a book a fountain similar to this with a statue by John R. Bologna.  I remember, I think, the originals of these and I believe there are two such fountains, so that if we actually reproduced those fountains we would have something particularly well suited to our location.

The advantage of fountains of this kind with statuary is that they would not only be effective when seen from the approach or from below, but would be beautiful from the windows of the house, and of course would be interesting to anyone on the terrace and in their immediate neighborhood.

This plan works out very well, as I say, according to the location of the land; and it also gives us a little different plan then we have had at the other houses, where the fountains have been located along the center axis of the terrace.

I have tried to mark this in  a way to make myself clear on the drawn plan you sent me.

Regarding these side terraces, you may desire to 
extend them a little farther in front for architectural effect, and I think this perhaps would be a good thing to do.

If you want to make the fronts of these terraces bode or semicircular, I have no objection of course; or if you prefer to make them rectangular but still to extend them, that would be equally satisfactory to me.

I am rather in favor of some extension to relieve the monotony of a more or less straight front.

Sincerely,
