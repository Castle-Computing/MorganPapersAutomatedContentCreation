Dear Mr. Hearst:-

I enclose list of contents of twelfth carload.  The photographs go under separate cover.

Practically all of the photographs of goods in the eleventh and twelfth carloads were made before I received your instruction as to the use of the yard stick. That is why you have not seen the yard stick in the photographs. Also some photographs are obtained from the dealers who already had negatives.

In regard to the wall font from French, that had been repaired principally on both sides of the top, only plaster of paris had been used to plaster the parts together.  These parts became loose in handling and I had them wrapped in paper and put in the box.  When the front is set up permanently the parts can be cemented.

There is a spring and mattress for the English bed, and spring and mattress for the wrought iron bed. On the interior of the sides of the iron bed there are two lugs, which Benguiat did not remove.  They will have to  be removed in order that the spring will fit.

Sincerely,
s/ L J Oreilly
