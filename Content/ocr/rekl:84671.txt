Mr. Harrison H. Dodge,
Mount Vernon, Virginia

Dear Mr. Dodge:

	Mr. Hearst referred your letter in
regard to one of a pair of blue vases his mother
purchased, one for Mount Vernon, one for her own
collection, to me. I have no way of recognizing 
this vase, but if you will send me a kodak of the 
one you have at Mount Vernon, I will attempt to 
locate its mat, if still in Mr. Hearst's possession.

	Yours very truly, 
	
	JM-M
	
	Original letter of Mr. Dodges is in H.O. Hunter file
