Dear Mr. Hearst:

The Duplexes are not more than 11'-8" wide,- the South ones a few inches more.  
There would be more opportunity to set [Handwritten: the balcony] up suitable in 
one of the North Towers, as you suggest.  We will need the mantel and can surely 
place it suitably in one of the fine rooms.

I had to open up the proposed ceilings for the two South Duplexes and am "thrilled" 
with the Italian one particularly.  Of course, the dimensions given proved incorrect, 
but I have thought of another way of combining them which I will bring for your 
consideration this week.  They will give two very rich apartments, comparable with 
the Doges suit ones.

Camille Solon has worked all week drawing out, in place, treatment for girders, 
ceiling soffits and beam of the Roman Pool -- while his brother has been "laying 
in" the work on the Celestial ceiling.  This makes the Celestial work seem to be 
slowing down, but we have to get the Plunge ceiling treatment settled in order to 
finish up.

It hailed and stormed Saturday, which I hope was in the nature of a last farewell 
to real winter.  Mt. Diablo this morning is snow covered as far down as can be seen 
from here.

As always,

Yours truly,
