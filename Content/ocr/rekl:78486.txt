May 14, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Clark gave me a copy of your telegram relative to records of employees on the Hill.

I have known the antecedents and character of all men we have directly sent to the Hill, - these generally being skilled mechanics.  The difficulty has always been in governing character of men employed directly by Mr. Rossi on the Hill.

Your telegram is understood by Mr. Rossi, and I will go through his list in detail on the Hill Tuesday.  He feels 'not involved', as the gateman was employed by Mr. Slattery, but that just chanced to be.  I will do my best to drive the lesson home.

I believe your idea of identification cards with photographs would be very helpful - the possession of the card to be held as an honor conferred on the holder, while practically the photograph of any one whose past is in doubt can be submitted to the bureaus here and in Los Angeles for a check up.

Yours very truly,
