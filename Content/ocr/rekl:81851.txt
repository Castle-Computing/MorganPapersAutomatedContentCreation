Dear Mr. Hearst:

The last of the shipment of primitive paintings were opened today and am glad to report 
that the defects were in the photographs and that the paintings are all in excellent 
condition, although the frames of some first encountered are badly worm eaten.  It has 
been a great pleasure to become acquainted with this lovely collection.  Many thanks 
are yours for the privilege.

There was nothing hurt by poor packing.  Evidently was carefully sent, but would suggest 
that in future all pictures be covered with tissue paper or a soft material like in the 
top of French mix candy boxes, to keep the frames and surfaces of picture from being 
chafed by the movement in transit of the brown paper pads.

Yours very truly,
