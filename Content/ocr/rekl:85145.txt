Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Miehiels was not at the Ranch Sunday but have a letter form him saying that 
the price of 32 light weight bells of your design and finish would be $4800.00, or 
$150.00 apiece on average.  I had written George Loorz asking him to explain to Mr.
 Miehiels we only want the eight bells and to have him put his price for these in 
 place and connected in writing for you.

Yours very truly,
