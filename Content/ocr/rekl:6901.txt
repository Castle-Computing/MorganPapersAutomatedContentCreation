Dear Miss Morgan:

I think it would not be a bad idea to have six or eight out-door standards of light in the garden of the plaza circling the pool  A button in the main house could turn these on at night and they would give a nice illumination. 

Among the things that I sent out rather early last year were paid of terra cotta and bronze standards. I imagine that kind of thing would stand the out-door climate best and if you like those you might see if you can have them reproduced on the Coast; that is, if the idea appeals to you. 

I am sending some things that are of the Georgian period, and they would better be stored in San Francisco, as I have intended those for ranch-house below, when remodeled. 

I thought we would fix it up as a sort of Colonial establishment. Will you have Mr. Washburn or somebody get me the dimensions of the house as it stands, the floor areas of the various rooms, halls, etc.? 

I imagine we can use the house as it stands for the central motif, and add wings.

Sincerely,
s/ W R Hearst
