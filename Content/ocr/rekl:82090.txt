Dear Mr. Hearst:

In answer to your telegram, Mr. Rossi did call my attention Sunday to the approximate 
location of the corner column of the Recreation Wing and I asked him to locate it 
exactly, and that if it went inside the concrete curb of the tree box, the shape of 
column could be changed, but to lay it out and to send me the exact conditions.  I 
certainly would not risk any injury to that tree.  The information has not yet come,
 but we will redesign as necessary.

We expect to get in touch with the tree men tonight, and will send them down as soon 
as possible.

As regards the Tennis Court upper terrace pavement, I asked Mr. Rossi to leave the 
slab off until we were sure that the height of the wall, and the relationship of the 
pavement to the other terraces and to the mounds formed by the roots of the various 
oaks were certainly right.  There was, and is, no difficulty in establishing it on 
the same level as the Theatre Terrace if you wish it set definitely at that level. 
It is hard to get what the effect will be with all the material around, and once in,
 it is hard to change.

Yours very truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
