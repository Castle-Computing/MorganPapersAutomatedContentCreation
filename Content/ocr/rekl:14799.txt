Dear Miss Morgan:

, I. In comparing our place here with the Italian villas
I find that the main advantage the Italian Villas have over
us are in the matter of Wide terraces. v '

. Our walks and terraces are generall narrow and
“not formal, the ESplanade being the one notab e exception.
We have practically no large terrace areas in the na ure of
plazas except the one in front of the main house. Of course
we will have another at the east end of the main house when
we construct the patio, but I think the whole grounds would"
assume a more formal and finished aspect if we transformed our
walks into formal haplanades and .aved them with tiles and
.bordered them more or less rigid y with vaSes or railings
or statuary, etc.

The two terraces on either side of the pool and the
fli hts of steps leading down are going to be attractive V
fea ures. I suggest we make these terraces as big as pOSSible
and the Steps as wide and stately as possible.-

, . All these thin s on a big scale will help toconform
the landscape to the sea e_of the main house and in addition
they Will make the grounds much more livable as well as much

I»

more stately.

I would like to go over the grounds with you to see
where these esnlanades and terraces can be made. .I think the
pomegranate walk should be widened to about the Width of our
present es lanade and I think another eSplanade should be insert»
ed in the andscape, possibly by Widening the present walk
which goes partly around the hi 1 and jOins up With the terraces
in front of the ouses. , ‘

I think there should be some very wide terraces below
the present wall on the west and south sides particularly. rhe
road rather prevents anything of that kind on the north side.
However, effective'terrgces can be put in front of the new
north house, which we'can call House D or Casa del Canyon for
identification. “

The wide terraces below the present wall can be
approached b very impos1ng flights of steps on the order of
the steps be ow tie pool. ,Earticularly can features of this .
kind be built in front of Houses A and C, and probabhy in front.
of House B, which will be the new house on the south side. ,

I should think two such lower eSplanades and terraces
could be built before W8 come to the final lower wall, which
we have v iely planned, and which would be an eSplanade
covered Wi h a'W1de pergola bearing grape vines.

I think there should be fountains and Various
features such as columns and statuary to emphaS1ze the
1mportant points on the new terraces and stairways, and .
that there should be temples and towers and pools at varlous
VieWpoints and pleasant places.

I don't see why we can’t build something cons icuous
and useful and attractive too in the middle of the bla
Space to the meet that We 'lways feel needs filllr up. I mean
tailspace west of the poo in the middle of that s retCh of lower
W8. 0

' Perhaps we might have a temple here, or an Alhambra
toner, or a Moorish paV1llon, or Chinese tea garden, or some-~
thing that would be effective and enjoyable.

I would also suggest that we put columns or some

feature on each side of the cascade terminating the eSplanade
where it turns and goes up back of the Neptune fountain.

. ﬁe can.walk over the grounds and plan out these
things. I am merely making these notes as reminders.

Sincerely yours,

The money'that we would snend on this road I would
prefer spending on a dam. Hr.‘Eoesi has selected a dam Site
at the foot of the ravine and I am asking him to haVe the
necessary tests of the flat bottom made, to be sure that we
can build a dam there, and also to have the Specifications
made and estimates of the cost accurately made.

_ Apgarently we can build a forty foot dam for about
E50 000, or he cost of the road which we have deCided not to
u .~

ild

This dam would hold Elenty of water for irrigation
and should make a very pretty she and fish nond. It would
solve hr. Earksf water problem and to a certain extent
relieve the drain on the Hill's water supply.

If our road building crews get through their road work
by the latter part of Sentember, they should be able to build
the dam and have it completed before the first of the vear.
fernaps the crew that has worked on menagerie hill_could be
transferred to Chinese hill and take off the too of that
hill, and in a way make way for our ambitious plans for the
salt water pool.

This is nerhaps the finest site any where around
here and the question of how best to take advantage of it
in the matter of construction is quite important.

I have various vague plans which I would like to
discuss with you. ﬁr. Hunter has sent you a number of
Eictures and suggestions for various features. I am merely

rying to lay out here the general plan for the fall and
winter work.

Sincerely yours,
