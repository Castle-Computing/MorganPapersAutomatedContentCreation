[Letter - Return Receipt attached]

October 13, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In regard to fire screens - Do you se them so decorative that they become "features" in themselves, or do you seem them simple?  I have been slow in getting them because I realized you did not like those we had made, - and yet the ones of the type of the "cut" enclosed are found in so many new houses, decorator's shops, etc. that they might not seem very distinctive.

It has been the lack of sureness, rather than laziness which has held them back.  I enclose a few sketches.

Yours very truly,

[handwritten note]
