Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Joy tells me that the tiles with the surface of our tiles will not adhere to cement and that consequently we could not lay the tiles in cement.

That being the case, I think there are two things to be done -- either have tiles made with the proper kind of a surface where they will adhere to the cement, or else have something that looks like tile made of composition of a kind that would enable us to fasten the composition tiles definitely to the roof either by means of cement or by clamps or nails or other means.

If we cannot do anything else, we can use flat tiles.

Then again -- is there not some kind of glue or adherent material which will stick t a tile even if ordinary cement will not?

I think it would b work our while to make all kinds of experiments before putting the big roof on.  It would be desperately inconvenient to have to relay tiles there after every storm.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
