Dear Mr. Hearst:

Some practical points:-

The beds are all mattressed, etc.  and Mrs. Lee says there is bedding enough, - but I would like to add to the "open-eyed-ness" by having the spreads on,a nd willgaldly take care of it if you will let me know where to look for them.

Then as to shades of some kinds, - Mr. Kreiss, who is fitting the lambrequins, etc. took measures for shades.  Shall we wait until you come, or order a light grayish buff shading to go on each sash and open with it.

One cupboard in each house has been fitted up with suitable cleaning utensils.

The electric fixtures are slow in arriving .

The tile floor of the sitting room of C is down and looks well, and tile is gradually arriving for steps of various terraces, but the output of the kilns is as small as ever and it is coming in spoonfuls, as it did for the house friezes.  Some of it is lovely in color.

I have been desole over the water shortage as we could have had all the concrete terraces in otherwise, and the red tile on.  The men really have worked.  Van der Loo and his crew came down last week and his shops are being cleared away. There were few things for him to do, like the decorations above the lowest door of A, but he used too much water.  The space is plastered over so as not to look badly.

Yours very truly,
