Dear Mr. Joy:-

It is absolutely necessary to have doors into the bathrooms at least twice the thickness of the present ones.  I do not care how cumbersome these doors must be, but they may be made that thick and they should be in addition shut into felt lined jams. The present ones are quite impossible.  It is like having no door at all between the bath rooms and the bed rooms.

Also, when we get to the screen doors we should make them tight enough to exclude the scorpions and centipedes as these things appear to have a very social disposition and are much disposed to intrude upon our privacy.

The swinging lanterns at the corners of the houses will undoubtedly have to be removed during the winter or they will be broken by winds.  Some light, however, should take their place and I suggest that a smaller and better constructed iron lantern be substituted.

Very sincerely,
