Dear Miss Morgan:

Will you please ask Mr. Rossi to pour the pigeon house immediately on the roof of the wing of the east patio, so that I can have a place from which to liberate the fan tail pigeons.  I think they would be very pretty around the houses and I think that Mr. Rossi has nothing else very pressing to do with his concrete mixer at the moment and could very well make these pigeon houses now.

I am sending you some suggestions for sundials with flower beds around them.  I think the astrolabe in H.H.Rogers' garden is a good thing to duplicate, and the sundial in Mrs. Crawford's garden at Orange is interesting on account of its size.

Perhaps there are even better ideas of this kind available somewhere.  I think we should use some form of this, however, in the new gardens we are making.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
