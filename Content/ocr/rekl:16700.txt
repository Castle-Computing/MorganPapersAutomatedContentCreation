Dear Mr. Hearst:

Through Mr. McGregor we got the name of the slate people who furnished your New York slate floor.  They sent the samples, mailed to you today, from which to select the color [handwritten] for the library lobby.

Shall I just write to send the slate of color and range furnished for the New York work?

Yours very truly,
