Dear Miss Morgan:

I am very sorry but I had to drop Mr. Hearst a line telling him of my conditions and 
asking him to reconsider his order - especially as I have done nothing to cause such 
a decision.

It may do no good but at least it will give him an idea of my plight. - If in any way 
you can help it would be appreciated.

I am terribly upset - so I haven't the head to do much.  If the order stands, in a few
 days I shall clear up my office and come down to the house where I should like to 
 remain until Ulrich comes down and then we could pack up and get out.

Going tot. Louis may be fine.  I was just reading over Lundgren's letter,- he tells me 
"It takes a builder of keen imagination to execute Mr. Maybeck's ideas and this 
surely is a place where you would fit in."  Quite encouraging don't you think?

Well let us hope that everything is for the best and that with your help I may go 
there -- The only thing which gives me a lot of worry is - that I should not want 
to take Ulrich from school - and unless I get something to do I shall have to.

(over)
Let us hope again that things will not be as bad as I picture now them.

Most sincerely,
