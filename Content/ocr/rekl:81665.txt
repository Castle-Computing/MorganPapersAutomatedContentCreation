Mr. Hearst's Instructions

October 30, 1928

Take out yellow euonymus below C and plant there yellow cannas.  (I begged for 
background of one row myrtle.  He said "try it.")

Put yellow calendula in 2 beds below above for the winter & perhaps yellow French 
marigolds for the summer.  (I would edge with a border of gazania or large-flowered 
cerise mesembryanthemum.)

Put yellow cannas in bed to the south of C.

Take out white cleanders form below C.  Does not very much like geraniums.

Plant lower terrace new wall to hanging geranium -- lantana and polyantha roses above.  
(He would like large beds cannas either side (beds) cascade?)  (Not positive 
instructions.)

Plant fuchsias in place of plumbago on balustrade and also on this small bank -- 
below B.

S.W. corner B (bed in which we now have yellow cannas) for Fall 1929 plant dahlias here
 and as far down bank as possible (instead of hydrangea) -- likewise on east corner 
 beds -- (This does away with my instructions for delphinium).

Remove morning glories from B and put on various tall palm trees.

Fern garden -- Remodel this -- Replace with good soil and plant to fine (only fine) 
ferns, begonias and lilies.  I had better get for this cibotium ferns and alsophila, 
also to put with ferns some "Japanese-looking" little Macaena palms.
Plant polyantha roses all back of Tony's hanging garden - also tuberoses.

Wishes quantities of tuberoses and lilies everywhere.
Wishes coproama reduced along esplanade - keeping well back of palm tree line. 
Wishes the orange trees that are in the boxes spaced differently.
