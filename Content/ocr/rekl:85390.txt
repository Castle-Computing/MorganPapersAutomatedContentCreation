Memorandum for Mr. B. R. Maybeck

Dear Mr. LeFeaver:

At the Brown office, we went into the history of the Telegraph Hill project from 
the beginning, considering the various designs Brown's office has proposed.

Through one of the office windows Telegraph Hill in silhouette is clearly seen, presenting a 
unique opportunity to study the entire composition.  The various tower designs proposed were 
made to scale with the view of the Hill, then cut out and pasted on the glass to seem to top 
the Hill.  Of the many, early and late, designs tried out, the one originally proposed by the
 Brown office was clearly the best.  The base was wider and the shaft lower than in the later
 suggestions which were the result of various ideas advanced by outside parties.
