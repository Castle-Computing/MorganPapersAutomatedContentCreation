Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Miss Morgan:

We should erect at upper gate, at cross roads, at various points on pergola, and 
perhaps at reservoir, the statuary and fountains, etcetera, which we can obtain from 
the old San Francisco fair.

Are we prepared to do so?

Sincerely yours,
s/WR Hearst
