Will take Sunday dont mail

May 22nd, 1930

Dear Mr. Hearst,-

I am sorry the elevator has been so unsatisfactory and can see the better solution 
that the circular cage offers.  At the time, the firm members here did not think it 
practical.  Also have sen for some time that an all metal cage would be stiffer.

If you were not going to be needing the elevator for a couple of weeks after we had 
the new tracks and a metal cage ready, the actual time to reinstall a cage would be 
little as it would not be necessary to change anything but the form of the platform 
and cage - no rebuilding of shaft or of machinery.

I will be up Sunday with a layout.

Very truly yours,
