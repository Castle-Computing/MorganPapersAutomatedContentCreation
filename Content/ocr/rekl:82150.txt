September 5, 1929

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In accordance with your wishes, we have deposited the $2500.00 given us for Mr. Joy's 
European purchases, and we have sent to Prince Pignatelli a foreign exchange check 
payable to Romanelli for $850.00 and a foreign exchange check payable to Carlo Freter 
for $1400.00.  These checks will be delivered direct to payees by Prince Pignatelli 
according to the status of the work.

The small balance of $250.00 left out of this fund we will include with the next 
payments when due.

Very truly yours

Julia Morgan
