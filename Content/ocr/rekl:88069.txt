Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your request "not to allow any stain or varnish on the parchment shades" was carefully 
followed.  The shad complained of was the one sent from San Simeon to the shade maker to 
copy, and was returned to San Simeon, attention of Mr. Williams, to be put with the 
other three of the original attempt.

Yours very truly
