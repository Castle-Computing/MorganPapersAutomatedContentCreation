Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday I cabled Mr. Byne as you directed to buy the late Gothic gallery, stair 
balustrade, etc.  from the palace in Palma, Majorca.  A copy of the cable is enclosed
 -- also prints of the sketch, and a copy of his letter is enclosed on account of the
  price memoranda.

Yours very truly,
