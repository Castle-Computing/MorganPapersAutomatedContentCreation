Dear Mr. Hearst:

I.  I will follow up as rapidly as possible the moth proofing of rugs, fabrics etc. as you suggest in your telegram from Albuquerque.

II.  Am still on the trail of the Copenhagen jars.  There are two ÒCopenhagensÓ at Wyntoon, one with ducks and other with cranes and storks.  A hunt through eighty-seven boxes and barrels of all kinds of things from The Hacienda at San Simeon shows them not to be there.  Sunday I will make a thorough search through the yet unopened boxes, etc. at the Hacienda.

The search shows the need of a listing similar to that we have now for the antiques -- as it is practically impossible to recognize objects on present lists.

III.  The Luis Ruiz ceiling is, as suspected, a three sided one to cover a room about seventeen feet wide if used in its original form.  It would cover about twenty-two feet laid flat.  Should you decide to use it for the Refectory the material in the extra length (if it is one hundred feet long) could be used to make up the needed width.  It has the advantage of being a very flat ceiling about like the center panel in the Patio vestibule ceiling, only colored and decidedly Moorish in character.

Yours very truly,
