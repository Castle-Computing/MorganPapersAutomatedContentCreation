JUNE 2, 1928.
Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Bldg.,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan:

It is a good idea to use the present hill
reservoir for salt water and to build a large new fresh water
reservoir. We need a new fresh water reservoir in any case
and it should be big enough to carry a large reserve over the
dry months.

2. I have no use for the power plant and you
can use all that machinery for any purpose you see fit.

Sincerely,
