Mr. W.R. Hearst
137 Riverside drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is a hasty collection of plan questions, -- duplicating the ideas, though perhaps not exactly, -- those mailed to your London address; - also some photographs of a revised sketch model.  There is much work to do on the detail, but am pretty sure we have the quality and proportions of the masses.

Mr. Howard gave me a photograph of a series of four arches he says you own. -- I have enclosed a plan suggesting their use in the breakfast room alcove under the Venetian motif, -- as the four bays about work with it in size and arrangement of columns.  It could be copied to repeat on the ends, or Mr. Howard says you have bought other arches from him which might correspond sufficiently in size and character to use.

As to House A.  The sitting room is going to be very effective - much more so than it gave promise of when you were here.  The marble railing is up in the lobby and it looks well.  The ceiling in the down stairs lobby is beginning to show up even with the early painting coats. -- But there is a question in my mind as to the four columns.  The shafts are exactly right but the four caps are certainly too overwhelming in scale for the finest of the detail all about.  would you be willing to use the shafts and let us make capitals which could be gilded, of suitable detail?  Or would you think best to go back to the one pair of sienna marble columns?  We could use the capitals for sarcophagus supports.

It has taken a little time for Mr. Kincaid to start off as explained before and we both thought it best to begin the new building with 
new men, but things are now in good swing.  I have marked on the sketch about the excavation area now dug out.  Any faster progress would mean more dump trucks, more men than can be worked efficiently etc.  Is this according to your judgment?  In a general way would you say to choose economy, or speed?

The garden has been the hardest problem to solve, but believe we have it now.  -- The garden has not suffered, and looked very pretty yesterday.  The paths in the garden of the plaza are all in successfully.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
Enclo.
