Miss Julia Morgan,
San Simeon.

Dear Miss Morgan:

	I do not think anything to support 
the sunrise and sunset statues at the pool would be as 
good as rather tall columns, something on the style of 
the column on which they were supported at the Exhibition. 

	Let us plan those, and see how much 
they would cost. 

	Sincerely, 
	WR Hearst
