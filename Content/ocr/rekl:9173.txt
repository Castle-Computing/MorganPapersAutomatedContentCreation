Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday at San Simeon Mr. Lee was not enthusiastic about undertaking the fencing, as he said economy to you in his getting new men as they would be "day wage" men, not "month and board" ranch hands.

I think the fence could be put up the most economically by using one gang of twelve to fifteen picked men part time, using them on orchard, road, garden, concrete, et. etc., as conditions of weather, ground, supplies, etc. made it advisable, as the temporary fence around the orchard will make it not imperative to get the main fence up at a certain date.  If you would prefer putting the fence through with a separate "gang"  we can do that, but it may not mean taking care of the men in weather when they cannot work.

Reduce as much as possible it will take about the following "camp" to work to advantage for the next two months:

	(Washburn
	(Tompkins and Richard
        6  (Gillespie
	(Men from Niles Nursery (keep)
	(Hazzard

	(Cook			(
        3  (Dishwasher		)   New
	(Helper		(

	(New Labor Foreman   (Miller)
        4  (Teamster
	(2 truckman

	(3 carpenters
        5  (Divet
	(Lorenz
      12  (Laborers for garden, orchard, fencing, roads, concrete
      to  
      15	(Interchangeable, all picked men

	(4 plasterers
      11  (3 casters on stone balustrades, copings, etc.
	(3 Hadleys on mantels, tiles, etc.

       1 	(Office man, either Joy or Davis, as work demands

If you have any suggestions I will do my best to carry them out.  Van der Loo's Crew is working in some old sheds in Oakland, which has its advantage in that I can see the work almost daily.

The two upper bed room ceilings have been delivered at San Simeon and will go up the hill as soon as road permits.  The detail has been kept in beautiful scale and I both hope and think you will like the results.

The road is impassable from the fork up to the top, due to slides of the bank, but the road itself has held quite well.

If you would like to break every bone in your worst enemy's body treat him to the trip to Cayucos to Cambria.

Yours very truly,
