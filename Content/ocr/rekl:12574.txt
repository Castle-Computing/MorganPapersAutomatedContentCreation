Dear Miss Morgan :

I think that when we resume operations on the Hill we will have to proceed in a way to secure the maximum of efficiency and the minimum of expense.  I really find it a drain to pay the heavy bills due to this construction.

I know that a great deal of this is due to the location, but I imagine that some of it is due to other matters which can be corrected.

My plan is to have a thoroughly capable engineer and builder representing me in general charge of construction, he to get all his instructions and plans and specifications from yo, and to proceed with them according to your instructions, but only to proceed with construction when he has his plans and materials and everything necessary for the construction sufficiently ahead and sufficiently definite and determine to prevent delays, mistakes, reconstruction, and other matters of this kind, which have materially added to the cost of the enterprise on the Hill.

Of course this representative on the ground, whom I will select with your approval, must have the right to hire and fire as occasion requires; otherwise his authority would not be respected and he would be unable to secure the efficiency and expedition for which reason he will be appointed.

I am anxious to have this main building particularly finished in as brief a period as possible.  So I would like the time between now and say the fifteenth of March, when we expect to begin operations, utilized for the full and detailed preparation of all plans and specifications, for the accumulation of all kinds of materials, raw or manufactured, and for detailed preparation for all parts of the construction, so that there will be no interruption for any reason whatsoever from the time we start until the time we finish.

If this preparation cannot be made by the first or fifteenth of March, then i do not want to begin until it can be made, and until the man we put in charge is in a position to guarantee uninterrupted and efficient work.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
