Dear Miss Morgan:

The more I think about those statues and fountains and decorative bits we looked at this afternoon in albums, the more excited I am getting about them.  It was a wonderful idea that you had about using this material and it is going to make the hill something more distinguished than it possibly could have been under any other circumstances as we could not have hoped to have all those great artists working for us in any other way.

Please send me a telegram if you find this material is available and please let me know what is immediately available and what we will have to do in order to get the rest.

Can you also send me postals or photographs in duplicate of the things we selected as desirable. Would like to have time in mind and be helping to think how we could use them effectively.

Yours very truly
