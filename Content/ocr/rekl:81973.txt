Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, California

June 9, 1929.

Dear Miss Morgan:

We put up the damask at both ends of the hall and almost everybody agrees that the 
galloon down the middle is the best;  also that the appearance is greatly improved 
by the valance.

I think we should proceed on this basis.

Finally, I do not think I would like the fringe at the bottom of the damask.

I do not object particularly to the damask having the appearance of being stretched 
on the wall.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
