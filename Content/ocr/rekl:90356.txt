HEARST EXECUTIVE OFFICES
959 Eighth Avenue
New York

September 21, 1937.

Mr. William W. Murray
409 Hearst Building
San Francisco, California.

Dear Mr. Murray:

	Mr. White gave me your letter of September
14th, relative to the credits which Mr. Hearst did 
not reciev for built-in antiques

	I think it would be well if you would have
Miss Morgan make a list of these articles and estimate
the value of them. 

	When such list is prepared, will you send it 
to me so that I can take it up from the legal angle
first?

	Sincerely yours, 
	
	Edward G. Woods.
