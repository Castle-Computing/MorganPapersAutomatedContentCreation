[about Dec. 9, 1921]

My dear Miss Morgan:

I suggest that we do no construction on the lower wall until the various terraces are constructed.    In the meantime we can erect fences and move them around until we get just the right height and contour.

I will have some stakes driven for your inspection to show you where I think the wall should go.

2. There are some things in storage at San Francisco and arriving in the coming cars which should not be unpacked until they reach the ranch. These are things that we know perfectly well 
and don't need immediate data to remember or place.  There are the Three Graces for example.  They are life size copies of the Carrova Graces.  Then there is the Morgan well.  I know just what that is and where to place it.  They can be photographed here.  When I get a list of stuff in storage I can tell you what to ship here without unpacking.

3.  I think the fountain of the lion spitting into the tank (to phrase it poetically) is best placed on the center of the stairs opposite the court of C.  As you suggest lions are a specialty of house C.  This will be quite appropriate and suite effective.
We should place the Verona marble orange boxes as finals in either side of the fountain, the effect should be good.

4. as soon as we can I would like to build the pool with the Galatea I think it would rather complete the central Plaza from the Eastern side and give it a furnished look.

5. I have eight Verona marble columns offered in New York.  They might be eery good for a semi circle on the plaza back of the Galatea pool.  If you like the idea I will order them.  It is unusual to get eight.

Sincerely,
s/ W R Hearst
