Dear Miss Morgan:

I think that if we had a little more system in proceedings on the ranch, we would get more efficiency and more progress.  As it is, things take so long to finish that I am losing interest in the ranch.

There seems to be nothing except the small houses that are sufficiently completed to be comfortable in, and even in the small houses the smoking chimneys have not been corrected, and that makes them very unpleasant in the winter.

I suggest that we take a fresh start and try to get certain things finished.  I advise a different plan and a little different organization.

I think that Mr. Joy, or somebody in your office who is thoroughly competent, should be assigned to this ranch proposition, with instructions to devote his whole attention to it and to see that the work on certain things not only progresses but is concluded.  This situation needs the constant attention of somebody of knowledge and authority.

I suggest further that Mr. Rossi confine himself and his construction crew entirely to the finishing of the main house and the grounds, and the rectification of the faults in the three smaller houses.

Second.  I suggest that the orchardist and the gardener each proceed on a definite budget, and that these budgets be kept entirely separate from Mr. Rossi's construction budget, and that nothing be diverted from the construction budget to the gardener or orchard budget and nothing from the orchard or garden budget to the construction budget.

I advise that Mr. Rossi maintain his general superintendence of the orchard and garden, but devote his actual attention to the finishing of the main house, the completion of the pool, erection of the temple and construction of the filter and staircases of approach.  I would like to se these things finished and checked off one by one.

faster.  Mr. Rossi tells me that he can erect more if he can get more.  Let's push this through and get that material down here and put on the house.

It is now the first of the year.  We have not many months before summer, and I would like to see a lot of these things done by summer, and I know the way we are going now, they cannot be done, and that the same unlivable conditions will prevail unless we get very busy along some more systematic lines.

Sincerely yours,

Third.  I would like definitely to see any new construction, other than the above-mentioned, done by contract and in the contract I would like to see time, as well as cost and quality, specifically guaranteed.  Under these contracts, I would like to see the road work done, the chicken houses built, the servants' house on the hill built and the men's quarters for the ranch houses built.  After these are done, we can proceed with the dairies and barns, but until then I will not say whether the dairies and barns will be constructed by contract or by day labor, because I do not know how contracts will work out compared with the day labor; but I certainly would like to see the contracts tried with respect to the four above-mentioned propositions, viz: servants' quarters on the hill, men's houses below, chicken houses and the road work.

If these are done by contract, Mr. Rossi's forces and Mr. Rossi's appropriations and Mr. Rossi's personal time and attention will be left unimpaired and uninterrupted for the completion of the main house and gardens that I want to see completed at the earliest possible moment.

Fourth.  With regard to the interior of the main house, I would like to see some definite plan followed that will result in the completion of one room after another, and not the partial completion of half a dozen rooms.

I would like to see the assembly room finished.  I think the opening into the assembly room from the lobby should be made the proper size at once, and that the door frame should be planned and executed at once and the whole room and lobby finished.

I think then we should proceed with the finishing of the refectory and the finishing of the kitchen, and also the pantry.

I cannot see the reason for leaving all of these things unfinished so long and in such an unlivable condition.

After we get these main rooms finished, we can proceed to finish the library and the various suites of apartments, but let's do the main rooms first and get through with them and get the men out of them so that we can get into them.

Fifth.  In regard to the finishing material for the outside of the house, I think we should proceed with that a little
