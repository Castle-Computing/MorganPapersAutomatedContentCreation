Dear Miss Morgan:

Answering your wire, I do not know the little creeper, but if we are going in for that 
kind of thing why not have climbing roses of the small and quickly flowering kind?

Before doing this, however, I suggest that we put surface on the walls and paint them 
and see how they look.  Maybe they won't be so bad.

Sincerely,
