Dear Mr. Hearst:

The Doges Suite rooms are ready to move back into and while not as formally elegant, 
seem pleasanter than before.

In the Cloisters, the second and third rooms where the fireplaces and chimneys were 
remove, are again ready for furniture.  We gained two feet in width on the third room, 
which meant such expensive alterations to the ceiling to make it fit that it seemed 
better judgment to put up a similar ceiling which almost exactly fitted - did fit by 
the addition on either side of a set of little rather plain corbels provided by San 
Simeon - he missed the exact number needed by two only.  These rooms also look well.

The concrete slab forming the floor for the library end of your new study is poured.  
The big steel trusses are delivered and ready to raise as soon as the concrete is set 
enough to work over.

Up there yesterday one could visualize a bit of the imagined effect.  It will surely 
make a very beautiful room,- am only regretting that the kitchen wing roof, when 
raised, will cut off the view of the breakers down the headlands of the coast, lovely 
now from the end windows.

Work was stopped on the Neptune Pool, "Duplexes", etc. on receipt of your message via 
Mr. Willicombe. We  will concentrate on getting the roof on and completing the twin's 
room, the Gothic Baths, and the Celestial stair halls over them before shut down.  
It would be good judgment, if possible, to pour the rest of the South Patio Tower and 
the deck room, as we have the steel, iron, etc. delivered and will have to pay for 
it soon anyway.

The water shortage is acute and the value of reserve reservoirs evident.  For the first 
time there is good feeling and co-operation as to the allotment of water among the men.  
It has been the hottest and driest summer since we started on the Hill.

Perhaps household and warehouse people have been worked a bit hard, but have taken 
the opportunity to get many things needing attention out of storage, cleaned, waxed, 
mended, etc. - nothing like meddling! - but the need for it developed on the unpacking 
of a number of the articles you loaned the de Young Museum.

It will be fine to see you again.

Yours very truly,
