WE HAD IN MIND RESUMING OPERATIONS ON RANCH ON FIRST OF FEBRUARY AND I DO NOT WANT TO 
DO THIS STOP I THINK I WILL POSTPONE THEM UNTIL FIRST OF APRIL 2 WHAT CAN THE EXPENSES 
BE KEPT DOWN TO IF WE DO NOT DO ANYTHING ON RANCH 3 WHAT WOULD IT COST IF WE ONLY PUT 
UP THE NORTH EAST WING AND FINISH THE NORTH TERRACE 4 I DO NOT THINK I CAN BE ON THE 
HILL SUNDAY BUT I WOULD BE DELIGHTED TO HAVE MR AND MRS BYNE GO TO RANCH AND SEE IT AND 
STAY AS LONG AS THEY LIKE ALSO I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THEIR SEEING PHOTOGRAPHS IN YOUR 
OFFICE OF COLLECTIONS=

W R HEARST.
