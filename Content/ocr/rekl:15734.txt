Dear Miss Morgan:

I do not think Mr. Byne has been nice to us.  He write me offering me Gothic door, which I would have been very delighted to have, and then writes a few days later saying that I cannot have it because a friend of his who turned it down has changed his mind.

It seems to me that in all decency he should have waited until he got an answer from me first.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
