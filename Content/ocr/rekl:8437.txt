Mr. William Randolph Hearst
Las Estrellas
San Simeon, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Coming down from the camp Friday night, and looking back, I suddenly realized if the new supports were taken away from the middle front of "C" all the front of the building would become a mixed set of openings without definition.  Before putting in the new columns, would you consider the facade from that point of view.  From the lower terraces it does not suggest this difficulty at all. 

Yours very truly,
