Dear Miss Morgan:

I am informed that a whole boat load of old Spanish tile from Spain arrived at Miami, to be used on houses under construction in Coral Gables.  We do not seem to be getting our Spanish tile from Cuba.  Perhaps we had better get it from Spain.  Will you ask Mr. Byne about it?

Please also ask Mr. Byne if he can get any really magnificent Spanish grille out of some church or monastery, something almost approaching in quality the Ferdinand-Isabelle Church at Granada.  Ordinary grilles can be got, but I would pay a good deal for a fine one.

Have you heard anything from Byne about the cloisters that we called his attention to specifically?  They may not be as old as the one he has bought, but they are more decorative and some of them evidently considerably larger.

2.   I have talked with Mr. Rossi about the west facade, and suggested that it might be well to have other Gothic columns or pinnacles (or whatever you would call them) at the corners of the lobby.  I mean, of course, on the outside and corresponding in character to the Gothic pinnacles -- the ones that have the little Cupid sitting on the top.

I think that on the east facade we should have as much elaboration as possible, considering that it is now as important as the west facade.  I suggest that you make various treatments of this (that have the Venetian character, of course), and extend the effect of the Venetian balcony as much in width as you see fit.

I think we should have some definite decoration above the top of the balcony and below the gable.  The whole east end, including the patio, ought to be stunning, and I think we have some material that will go far towards making it so.

I have suggested to Mr. Rossi that, if he is successful in moving the two big oaks out of the patio, he might also try to move the big oaks that obstruct the entrance.  As it is, we have to carry the steps around the two we now have.  If he can move these, 
or even one of them, I would like to have them placed at the southeast corner of the tennis court.  It will be very valuable there, shading the court.  It is merely an obstruction where it is.  I think Mr. Rossi's plans will enable them to move the trees successfully.  If this tree is moved, it will give us a good approach.  Otherwise I rather despair of getting a good approach, because the trees throw the whole proposition out of balance.  With the trees out of the way, we can carry the steps straight up from the road to the patio.

I wish you would also design towers for the pigeons on each of the wings, and I suggest that they go at the southwest corner and the northwest corner, as these pigeon towers should be decorative and attractive with the pigeons, and I think they would be most effective on those corners.  However, if you would rather put them on the ends of the wings, I am perfectly willing.  I would like to have this work done as soon as possible, as I have kept the pigeons in coops for a long time.

Sincerely yours,
