Dear Miss Morgan:

I think it is about time that we had systematic lighting of the buildings and grounds.  We have had a haphazard one entirely, due to the unfinished condition of things.  I have gone over the situation with Mr. Joy, and I think we should order, probably from Mr. Rossi's people, about five dozen standards and globes of the large and luminous kind that we are for the most part using.

Mr. Joy and I figure that we would need fourteen of those in front of House A as it stands at present, and that we would need six in front of House C, and six in front of House B, and about a dozen in the grounds in various places, and another dozen on the stairways.

I suggested that Mr. Joy order, with your approval, five dozen of this kind of standard and globe.

There still remains the lighting of the balconies in front of the library, the lighting of the cascade, and the lighting of the new terraces that are being constructed.

I suggested to Mr. Joy that we take those caryatids from one of the Roman villas, where they are holding some kind of a cup or globe on top of their heads, and make some kind of cast-stone models out of these and put lights in place of the vase.

We could put two of these between the cypress, and that would make six for the terrace in front of House A, and six for the terrace in front of B, and perhaps there would be a dozen more used in other places between cypress in pairs.

And I think for the item of the cascade the very best thing to do is to put the caryatids that you are going to make into a pergola and make them carry lamps on their heads.

This will make six lamps on each side of the cascades, which should light them wonderfully.

Perhaps two standards and lights could be put one on each side of the fountain at the top.

Now comes the pool, which I forgot to mention above.  On the pool I propose to have two marble stairs on the west side and two on the east side and two on the north side. That makes six stairs altogether, and as each one will have a light on each side, that will make twelve lights.

This should amply illuminate the pool and the statuary and the fountain.  If anything further is needed, however, some lights could be put on top of the colonnade.

Miss Morgan--2.

This general scheme of lighting will illuminate the whole of the west side of the place from the facade of the house to the outer wall.

There is no use considering lighting of the east side yet, as it is not sufficiently finished;  but as soon as you get the lighting for the tennis court planned out and designed in detail, I would like to see that, and perhaps we can then plan out some lighting for the esplanade on the north sides of the house to connect up with the general scheme on the west side.

Of course the patio and the east side generally we will have to leave until next summer when that part will be completed;  but I think this scheme of lighting outlined here will do much to enrich the grounds.

2.  I have succeeded in getting half a dozen more fine yew trees from the Beverly Hills Nursery.  I am sending the worst of ours back; so there are plenty of yews now for the plaza in front of the gymnasium.  I imagine there will be twelve altogether.

Sincerely,
