Dear Miss Morgan:

Answering yours of the 8th, I think you can be pretty ruthless about the roots of the Bay trees where the Neptune Pavilion is going.  I do not think that a Bay tree allows anything to interfere with its intentions.  Anything that flourishes like a Bay tree is making a first class flourish.

2.  I would think we better not take out the material in the central plaza beds at present.  In fact it would be well to box the tree or concrete it and let it stand where it is for the present, making over the trenches, taking down the fences and making the plaza look as well as possible during the spring and summer.  We can finally move the tree later after the tourist season is over.

3.  I have the Encyclopedia Britannica of the objects in the warehouse.  It looks as if we would have a perfect Carnegie Library if we had everything in all the warehouses similarly photographed and catalogued.

4.  I think myself it would be well to have the chicken farms done as promptly as possible, but, as you say, it must be done properly.  I would like to talk over the plans with you.  In the meantime please hold Mr. Slattery back.

I hope to be able to go to the ranch next week. I have been laid up, having tried a little amateur surgery on myself, and somehow or other it was not quite successful.  In disposing of a pimple I acquired a high grade carbuncle.  I suppose professional surgeons have some use in the world after all.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
