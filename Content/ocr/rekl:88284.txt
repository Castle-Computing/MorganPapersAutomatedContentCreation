Grand Hotel - Roma

Dear Miss Morgan:

One thing that San Simeon really needs is fountains.  I mean fountains that FOUNT.

The new Neptun fountain should have a torren of water.

There should be a spouting fountain in the middle of the great north terracein addition to the two night and day fountains on each side.

We should and of course will have the big Diana fountain below-- but with lots of water.

On the west terrace we should have a large spouting fountain in the middle-- or else 
two on the sides.

On the south side we will have to wait until the terraces are built there.  But we should consider fountains in connection with these terraces.

After seeing the Villa Deste again I realize what water would do for San Simeon.  
It would double its beauty and charm.

In the midst of a dry land we would have an oasis of beautiful fountains.
The work must be done on a grand scale, and there must be not merely statuary and 
basins but WATER-- spouting, tumbling water.

All that is needed are reservoirs of sufficient size-- and pumps.

I think the best way would be to build reservoirs on Reservoir Hill.  Let the fountains be run by gravity, and then pump the water back to the reservoirs on the hill.

Enclosed are some photographs of Tivoli.  Maybe they will affect you as they did me.

We would not have the gigantic effect of the big waterfall,but we could have some splendid water effects-- small and LARGE.

We could have a great fountain in the space north of the inside pool.  We could also 
clear Menagerie Hill and have a formal lake there, with urns and railings, and a 
fountain in the middle, and a formal garden.

This lake could be the lower reservoir, from which the water would be pumped back to 
the mountain

Sincerely,

W R H
