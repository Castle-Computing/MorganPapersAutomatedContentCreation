Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Los Angeles Examiner,
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mrs. O'Brien's under spreads for the
Doges Suite beds are correct in idea, but they should
really be more like the formal valance of the period
of the beds.

We have no suitable material, but I
can see after this if you wish.

Yours very truly,

JM-M
