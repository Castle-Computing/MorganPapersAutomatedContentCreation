Mr. James A. Murray,
New York American,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Murray:

Thank you for your letters, photographs and car loads, which have all arrived.

May I make a few more suggestions?  When possible, if the whole of an article cannot go into one crate, could it not be in the crate by itself or with kindred articles?  Otherwise it means unpacking and repacking here, on account of San Francisco not being the terminal.  As it is, the original case no longer fits what is left in it and a new case has to be made for the article sent on.  In nearly all cases it would save money and handling.

The other suggestion is as to measurements:--that when the photographs are supplied by the dealers, someone make sure the measurements are on, and that they are placed on the article itself not on the margin,--This because in a number of cases last year measurements were given that were misleading.  By the way, the measurements are not on a number of the recent photographs and it is impossible to judge their size.

Your lists are very clear and should help greatly in the re-handling.

Sincerely yours,

JM-deM
