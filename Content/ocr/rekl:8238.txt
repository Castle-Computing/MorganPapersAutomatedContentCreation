THINK YOUR LOCATION FOR GRACES GOOD.  THERE IS ALSO NICHE WHERE STEPS COME DOWN AROUND SEMICIRCLE 1ST TURN THAT IS FINE FOR PIECE.  LIBRARY CEILING HALF UP TOWERS PROGRESSING NEEDED MATERIAL ON WAY.  THE SEMICIRCLE BELOW A WAS ON MODEL, MY MODELING - WOULD YOU PREFER STRAIGHT WALL ACROSS OR MADE WITH SCAT BETWEEN LARGE PAIR
