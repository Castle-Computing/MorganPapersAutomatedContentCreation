‘ ‘ *Thie ta in regard to the planting._
I paaaad'on.your‘meaaago taimr. Keep to nae the
eucalyptus trees in a single row about 15 feet
apart inatead ef 12 feet.

_ , " z-like'yqur idea «f carrying the
ouealyutus entirely arcane-chineae hill. a5 it
probably ﬁbula nut 190k well to ahanga the solar
anﬁ typo cf tree abruptly ana without some apparent
nataral.reaean.v As the pink crepe myrtle and red
ounalyptua_nelther bland ncr aantrast well togethmr
in-oelor. it would seem that the plane far the .Lnk
myrtle woula be an thg ngw north read. and the laa.=»
amanda on tha aauth road. as you anggaat. The way
ﬁns raad 1188 the crepe myrtle and annalyptne would
be neon together but for a'vary'ahart distance and
.from the road only, whila the Jaaamanda and enaalyym .
\tua would be eaan togethar-alwaya tram tha house. 33
«all as fram tha road. It 19 regresahla that the
flavoring aaaaon of thgge treaa 13 so short. The orapa'_
myrtlea at Portorv1119 gra huge trees. no that 16 they
follow precnﬁant. thﬁ myrtlaa aonld be planted 20 feet
or mare.apartg an against 15 feet apart for the euuau
lyptus. V v _ ’

. ' , _ I would like'either theVblne plumhaga;
or the heliotr0pe with the eucalyptna hetver than.tha

_ naaaia. .5190! me the banks either aide'tha crass axe
stair are plantad with yallaw-broom. and will present
a maﬁa a: yellow. it would be mare invareating to have
tha blue bank 9 as an intrnduction. Tha plamhago haa
tha advantaga of being hernia: than the helictrape.
requiring laaafwater and attentian_. but it is true
that I nawer saw heliotrOpe grow as it has on tha H111,
.an& it might thrive on these bank», but again it might
nat an wall an all 81496 at the Hill.

Yours very truly.
