Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, 
California.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
This is in regard to the planting. I passed on your message to Mr. Keep to use the eucalyptus trees in a single row about 15 feet apart instead of 12 feet.
I like you idea of carrying the eucalyptus entirely around Chinese hill, as it probably would not look well to change the color and type of tree abruptly and without some apparent natural reason. As the pink crepe myrtle and red eucalyptus neither blend nor contrast well together in color, it would be on the new north road, and the jac-amanda on the south road, as you suggest. The way the road lies the crepe myrtle and eucalyptus would be seen together but for a very short distance and from the road only, while the jacamanda and eucalyp-tus would be seen together always from the house, as well as from the road. It is regrettable that the flowering season of the trees is so short. This crepe follow precedent, the myrtles could be planted 20 feet or more apart as against 15 feet apart for the euca-lyptus.
I would like either the blue plumbaga or the heliotrope with the eucalyptus better than the cassia. Also as the banks either side the cross axe stair are planted with yellow broom, and will present a mass of yellow, it would be more interesting to have the blue bank - as an introduction. The plumbago has the advantage of being hardier than the heliatrope, requiring less water and attention - but it is true that I never saw heliotrope grow as it has on the Hill, and it might thrive on these banks, but again it might not do well on all sides of the Hill.
Yours very truly,
