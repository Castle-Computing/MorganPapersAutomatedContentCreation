April 4, 1923.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Under separate cover I am mailing a revised study of the Rose Garden area showing a suggested treatment for the paths and pool.

Yours very truly,
s/Thaddeus Joy

Regarding the pool I suggest that this fountain be kept separate from the pool - maybe at a higher level - and be surrounded by seats.  From these seats the houses can be seen on one side and the pool and temple on the other.  for example as shown in drawing.

There must be places where people can remain and rest and look.  The looker should be able to sit down at the best look out place.  I think he should be able to see the reflection of the temple in the pool.  Am agreeable to any better arrangement.
