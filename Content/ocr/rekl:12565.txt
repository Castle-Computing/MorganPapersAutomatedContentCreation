Dear Miss Morgan;-

In reply to your letter of November 27th, 1922, addressed to Mr. Murray, I am enclosing the photographs which you said you would like to have for your records.  They are as follows;

2 photographs of a large Stone Mantel of the 12th, Century.
1 photograph of a large Stone Bas Relief of the 16th, Century.

Also, I am enclosing three photographs of the Istrian stone Arches that were purchased from Howard & Company which you requested.  The Stone Arches were shipped to San Simeon, on December 14th, 1922, in car N.Y.C. 161889.  There are seventy five cases in all numbered rom 1209 to 1283 inclusive.  They were shipped by the Judson Freight Forwarding Co., who have an office at 517 Central Building, Los Angeles, Calif.

I have mailed a copy of the B/L to Mr. Fairchild at the San Francisco Examiner.  I trust that you will receive the cases in good order and beg to remain,

Yours very truly,
s/Gregor
