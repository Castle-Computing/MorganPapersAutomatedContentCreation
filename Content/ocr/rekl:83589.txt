April 26, 1930

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I had planned to bring the enclosed drawings of the vestibule to show with other 
drawings being prepared, but was unable to get away, so these are sent for your 
approval before starting Mr. Hellenthal on the work.

He has already removed the bar and is sealing one vault door and concealing the others.

Yours truly
