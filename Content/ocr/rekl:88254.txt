Dear Miss Flood:
	
	The enclosed bills are in order.
For your information, they were incurred in
making up a shipment back to New York of a 
carload of articles from loans to museums, 
the Ranch and Shasta warehouses, etc., -
entailing considerable local transfers,
crating, repacking, etc. 
	
	Yours very truly,
