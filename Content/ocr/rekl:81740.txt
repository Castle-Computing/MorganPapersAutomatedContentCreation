November 28, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

We received your telegram in regard to the marble hand rails and will try a similar 
design combining also the lamp standards if workable.

Mr. Joy sent the enclosed letter with one for the office here.  It took him some time 
to find himself there.  But I imagine he has made up for any apparently lost opportunity.

Yours very truly,
