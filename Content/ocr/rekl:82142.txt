Dear Miss Morgan:

Will you please have carefully packed and shipped to Miss Head for use in the great 
hall of Bradenstoke at St. Donat's Castle, the big English mantel which we could not 
use here at the ranch.

You will remember -- it is the one which we had up in the refectory and took down to 
s010-5-e-55-03-01put up the French mantel; it is 14 feet wide and about 10 feet tall.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
