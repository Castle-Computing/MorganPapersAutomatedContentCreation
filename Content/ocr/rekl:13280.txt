THINK OUTDOOR WORK DEPENDS ENTIRELY ON WEATHER IF WE HAVE DRY WEATHER WE SHOULD CERTAINLY FINISH WINGS ON REAR COURT APPEARANCES INDICATE DRY YEAR OUTDOOR WORK MAY BE POSSIBLE ALL THROUGH JANUARY THERE IS ALSO MUCH INDOOR WORK T BE DONE WE MUST SURELY HAVE SIX EXTRA BEDROOMS AND BATHS

IN A B AND C FINISHED DURING WINTER AND DECORATED AND FURNISHED BY JUNE FIRST PLEASE SEND CEILING SKETCHES MAKE THEM INTERESTING BUT NOT TOO ELABORATE WOULD LIKE SUGGESTIONS FROM BOOKS SO WE CAN DECIDE SOON AS POSSIBLE EXPECT GREAT MANY VISITORS NEXT YEAR AND WOULD LIKE EVERYTHING FINISHED AND READY EARLY.
