Mr. J. W. Willicombe,
San Simeon, Calif,

Dear Mr. Willicombe:

HEATERS IN NORTH SIDE STAIR TOWERS:

For permanent installations we must chip concrete to set the heaters back into the 
walls.  This is very noisy & dirty & inconvenient with the party here but can be done.

Since hot air rises quickly I believe it would be more economical and efficient to 
put one or more larger heaters either at the basement or 1st floor.  If we can keep 
the lower levels warm than upper levels will be comfortable or hot, I believe.

I will attempt to rig up a temporary heater, this date, in the elevator tower, t 
the head of the basement steps.

I will purchase a door-closer for the lower door of the Doges Tower North this 
afternoon.  It will take some work to make the sliding door at the head of this 
tower weatherproof.  Maybe we can put in a temporary heater at the head of the 
Saddle Vault steps this afternoon that will help a lot.

The North Deck room and cloister halls cannot be heated until the open hallway is 
glassed in as on the South side. This could be rigged up temporarily with wallboard 
and no windows quite quickly.  It would take several days to make it like the 
South side as we have no material on hand.

GRAVELING OF AIRPORT

We have all the necessary equipment and can do this promptly when the ground dries 
sufficiently for the equipment to move.  It will cost at least $2000.00 to gravel 
a 100 ft. wide landing strip for both directions.  Some grading might be advisable 
to insure perfect drainage of these strips.  This would add to the cost, of course.  
No allowance made for equipment rental.

P. S.  THE ADDITION OF THE HEATERS IN THE RECREATION WING AND NOW IN THE STAIR 
TOWERS WILL BRING AN EXCESSIVE OVERLOAD ON OUR MAIN TRANSFORMERS.  THEY HAVE BEEN 
OVERLOADED BUT NOT DANGEROUSLY. NOW...WE ARE NOT SO SURE.

Sincerely,
s/ Geo.

 We can get along with our temporary heater on first floor near elevator 
for present and later attack the whole heating problem including larger transformers.  
Need corridor adjustments proper (?)

Please grade and gravel the lower field for 100 ft wide strip or more thing 100 ft is 
enough 150 ft better
