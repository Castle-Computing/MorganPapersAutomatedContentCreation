Dear Miss Morgan,

I am sort of discouraged about the gardner

First he makes a jungle of the garden.  Everything is too thick and ranck 

Second there isnt any order to the garden - not any apparent plan. 

Third there is no color
scheme and no apparent feeling for color effects. 

Finally the flowers are everywhere beaten down by too much watering   The gardner waters them as if he were putting out a fire.

I think it may be possible to retain this gardner on the place if we could get a tasteful gardner to come down once a month and give him a layout.  What do you think of this plan.

Sincerely

s/WR Hearst.
