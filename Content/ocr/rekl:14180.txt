December 8, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

After seeing Mr. Pancost Saturday, I went on to San Simeon although knowing it might be raining -- and it was -- You might think that poor judgment, but seeing how the roads, roofs, etc. actually conduct themselves pays.  Mr. Keep  put his beaming face between the automobile curtains and announced that the weather was "heavenly" - cold not possible be finer and all his things in fine shape.

I had with me the working drawings for the chicken houses and Jersey cow barns.  the chicken houses and weather need not interfere with, but it was evident that hauling on roads from a new quarry site, and handling men in the wet would add perceptible to the cost.

The fireplace in you sitting room is changed as agreed and seems to be a success -- The forms for the stairs to the Celestial Suite are ready to pour concrete into, and the plumbing for the new baths underway.

It is planned to close the camp on December 20th, leaving only the necessary men on the Hill.  While Mr. Rossi is down on his vacation I have arranged to have his foreman, Peterson, stay on the hill -- a reliable man, and equal to emergencies.  Mr. Rossi will be down two weeks as he has not been away at all the entire year.

It will require the following list of men without construction work, on account of this being the time for orchard and garden work.  Mr. Webb and 3 men, Mr. Keep and 2 men, Mr. Gillespie and 2 laborers to keep roads in order and plow, 
teamster, truckman, electrician, cow man, coyote and animal men, Richard, Mr. Baldwin, Mr. Peterson, and the cook and his helper.  Which is quite a camp in itself.

Your telegram as to closing for the winter was here on my return and i will send word up not to engage anyone to go back after the holidays, except as above.  Would you think best to cut any on the above list?

I will be in Los Angeles Monday and could bring the service wing studies, if you would care to have me.
I have not forgotten the cow man and HAVE several possibilities if we cannot get the man I told you about.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
