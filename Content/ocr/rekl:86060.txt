Dear Mr. Hearst:

I do not think that Mr. Bronson Williams is a regular dealer.  He called at the office 
with an introduction and said he had just returned form a South American trip and had 
been commissioned by the owner to dispose of a collection of old paintings he saw there.

He had no photographs with him, but later they came with his letter, and I carried out 
my promise to forward them.

As always,

Yours truly,
