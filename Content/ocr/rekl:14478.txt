Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange
San Francisco, Calif.
Dear Miss Morgan:

Will you please see Mr. B. A. Clark about the man to
take charge of the Jerseys. He has several under consideration,
but I don't think any of them are as good as the man.you have
in mind. However, you may want to talk to Mr. Clark and get
an estimate of the value of his list.

A I am also on the lookout for a cheese maker. There
is a man in Petaluma who makes Camenbert cheese which is sold in
New York and considered the equal of the French Camenbert. This
man has an agency in the California Market I think. The Van Dome
Shop, in New York, which handles his cheese, says he is a
Frenchman who formerly made Camenbert in France.

I think he makes the best American cheese and I would
like to get him to make Camenbert cheese on the ranch.

I would also like to get somebody who could make the
real Swiss cheese, with the holes in it. I have never known
of any good Swiss cheese to be made in this country. Perhaps
we will have to import a man from Switzerland.

Sincerely,
WR Hearst
