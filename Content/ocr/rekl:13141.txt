Deer Hr. Hearst:

~ ~Mr. Gillespie mentioned leet week that you
*wented the new poate for the fence to be 8" x 8"

as those we need leet eeeeon were not etrong enough
~~ end incidentally mentioned that he had told you
the poorer poete should have been rejected before
shipment. I -

For information regarding the poets I en~’
01036 the following dete -~

When it came to actually making the purchase of
the rod wood posts or "stakes" the following condi-
tions were discovered a ‘

1. ’ﬂhet there was not enough redwood, of any grade,
6"x 6"x 10' in all the lumber yards around the bay
combined tofill the order. ’

2. That for en assured life of probably fifteen
years or more.it woul be neoeeeery to buy "butt a
outta", which would cost fifty percent more than
morohentable grade. if obtaineblei but,whioh could
not be secured in sufficient quantity even from the
northern mills. ‘

3. ‘That the next beet grade was "extra morohanteble"
which would cost from $800 to $1000 here then “more
chenteble" and deliveries Would have to be made per»
iodioally from the northern mills. v -

4. That the merohenteble grade could.be furniehed
a emell part from etook and the balance from mill
shipments, by the Charles Nelson Lumber Company and
the Acme Lumber Company. After getting hide from
both and.100king at hotho stocks and making epeoiel
agreemente'ee to grading. it eeemed that the Acme
Lumber Company would furnieh much the better steak.

A.oonfarenoe was then secured with the General
Purchasing Agant and the Assiatant General Purchaan
lag Agent of the Southbrn Pacific Company,fthe
largast users of redwood tias, posts and poles in
the eonntry, who spent about an hour discusaing all
phases of the matter. 'Thsy anhositatingly raecwaond~
ed tha pnrchaaa from tha Acme Lumbar Company, of the

"merchantable grade‘ Whila this grade is made up 9!-

?&$ Ho.1’and 2&% Ho. 2, it seemed that the replaoav

.monts after a few years would be more than aoVQred

—ahantable". « , ~

mpat of the shipments were inspoatea at the dock,
but an agreemant wag made with.the shippars that any
‘found defective on arrival would ha replaced. on '

. December 9th, 1922 we received a credit memorandum

from the Aoma Lumber Company to cover all posts found, '

éefective on the nursery inapeotion posaible at the ‘

wharf, and the lumber ecmpany (our order file‘#577)

iforwarded in addition at their expense fifty extra» ,3
posts to replace thoae showing defects on stacking \ ' » j
§at San Simeon.' I did not think to tell ﬁr. Gilles? 1
pie not to use the rejected poats except in tempera» , 4 a
