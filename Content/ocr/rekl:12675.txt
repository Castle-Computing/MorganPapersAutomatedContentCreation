Dear Miss Morgan

Two men called today who would like to go to San Francisco.  Neither was fitted for the place.  Both were fine fellows.  The younger man, an Australian pleased me greatly but his experience is inadequate.  He is going to California and will call on us.  You will like his personality, evident good breeding and his evidence of good foundation but I do not think you can use him unless it be in place of Charlotte.  Besides he intends to return to Australia after 4 or 5 months on the Pacific coast.

The other is an Irishman apparently a skilled draughtsman and well trained in Ireland and England but lacking American experience
