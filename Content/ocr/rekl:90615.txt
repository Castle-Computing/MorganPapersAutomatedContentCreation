Miss Julia Morgan, 
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan:
	
	I have been asked to ascertain to what
extent construction at Wyntoon and San Simeon included
built-in antiques. Have you any record that will assist
me in arriving at the value of built-in antiques at 
these locations?

	If I remember rightly, you prepared such a 
schedule a number of years ago. Our records in this
office, upon which we based out book entries for capital
expenditures, do not show any value for built-in
antiques, but I believe they show the cost of labor
involved in installing them.

	Any information you can give me will be 
greatly appreciated. 

	Yours very truly, 
	
	WILLIAM W. MURRAY
