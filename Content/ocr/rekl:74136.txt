Dear Miss Morgan:

I would like to have my mother's rugs gathered up and put away again.  A great many of them are very valuable and everyone who comes up here with any knowledge of rugs remarks in a sort of shocked way that these valuable rugs are scattered around on the floor with people in country boots walking all over them.

Professor Pope is one of the men that commented on this condition and the rug dealer from Los Angeles the other day offered me ten thousand dollars for one of the rugs that was receiving rather careless treatment.

Many of these rugs could be hung on the walls as decorations but should not be put on the floor.

I do not know how they got on the floor.

I suppose some of the young men who do not know much about rugs found them in a chest and thought they ought to be used; but I would like them put back in the chest.

2. Another thing --

I think we ought to put a better exhibit of my mother's things at the Spreckles Trianon, if we are going to exhibit there at all.

As it is we have some oriental embroideries which have no great interest or value.

I am sure we could get a better and more interesting collection in my mother's material that is in storage.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
