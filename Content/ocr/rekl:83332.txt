Dear Mr. Hearst:

Tonight I am leaving for New York - the first trip there since we began on San Simeon. 
Mr. Joy is much better and is at your service, and Mr. McClure will arrive for good the
 middle of January.  All three of the young men who worked at #321 have had the same long
  hard illness.  Mr. Lloyd is still in bed.  The illness turns out to have been para-
  typhoid and the Lloyd doctor who was the only thorough one, apparently, thinks the 
  infection possibly was contracted through impure sea water as all of them bathed on
   the beach.  Of course they also drank the Santa Monica faucet water.

At San Simeon things are in good shape, - the Recreation Wing top poured. On the trip a
 week before Christmas, I found the slab steel in place already rusting and as the
  weather was good, the laborers only were needed and three days Mr. Rossi had it 
  finished.  He came to San Francisco for the holidays and will be here two weeks,
   having some doctoring done.  Mr. Lundgren will go back and stay until Mr. McClure 
   arrives.

I received your telegram giving the program for January and will use the money as you
 direct on San Simeon and on Wyntoon bills.

The red damask of the Social Room is being made up with no cuttingÂ  but will not be 
completed and hung again before the end of January.

I am looking forward to this vacation like an infant just out of school.

With kindest regards
