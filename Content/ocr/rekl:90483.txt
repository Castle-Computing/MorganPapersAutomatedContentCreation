Mr. William Randolph Hearst
La Cuesta Encatanda
San Simeon, Cal.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	As your truck was down here today, 
I took the advantage and had Sloane put on it the
only chair on their floors that looked at all
possible, it to be returned here. These chairs
would be $67.50 including the work of covering, 
but not including the cover material. 

	I will find others and send them
for inspection.

	As always,
	
	JM:F
