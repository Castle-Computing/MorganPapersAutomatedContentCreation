Miss Julia Morgan,

1135 Merchants Ex. Bldg.,
San Francisco, Cal.

Dear Madam:

We have been in correspondence with Mr. Tomkins at the Hearst Camp, San Simeon, regarding a telephone system for the new building at that point.

We have been informed that you are supervising this construction and we will be more than glad to lend any assistance possible in connection with the lay-out of a telephone system required for the building.

Yours truly,
s/?
