Dear Miss Morgan:

There is no hurry about clearing up the Wyntoon ruins.  You may do this in any way that
 is best and CHEAPEST.

2.  I would like to have plans for putting the Gables into the best possible shape as a 
dormitory for summer use.  I believe a dining room could be put where the store room now 
is and a living room put on the corresponding wing on the other side.  Probably over the 
dining room and living room additional bedrooms and baths could be located.

There should be no servants room in this house, according to my conception of the 
situation, although I am open to conviction on any of these suggestions.

I think when the proper season comes we should proceed with the men's dining room upon
 the hill and the reconstruction of the cottage and probably the erection of another 
 cottage for the Bosses and possibly the erection of a garage.

In the meanwhile I should like to perfect the plans for the building of the new castle.

I would like to see you sometime about these plans.  The sketch which Mr. Maybeck 
submitted seems to be artistically satisfactory. Of course there were no definite plans, 
no exact elevations and no ground plan showing the location of the various rooms. WE 
should be making some progress toward these details.

3.  My program for the ranch is, just as soon as we have settled weather, to complete 
the pouring of the north terrace, which is a small job, and of the north-east wing, 
which is a considerable job.

After that I do not think I will do anymore concrete construction for sometime, but 
instead I would like to proceed modestly to finish, inside and out, the concrete work 
that is already constructed.

I would like to talk to you about the cost of this program and I can say now that I 
do not want to spend much money until business improves, so we will make as economical 
a program as possible.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
