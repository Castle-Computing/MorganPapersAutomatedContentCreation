Dear Mr. Hearst:

It took so long to select the fixtures at Crane Co., there was not time to mail your enclosed clippings.  The idea of #215, pouring into a bowl, and then the bowl overflowing into the pool seemed interesting -- but perhaps without the entourage it might be stiff.

Yours very truly,
