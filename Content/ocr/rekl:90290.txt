Mr. J. Willicombe
Los Angeles Examiner
Los Angeles, Cal.

Dear Mr. Willicombe:

	The check for $116.80 which you received 
from the U.S. Customs Service under Entry 0490 refers
to the shipment of two vans and 15 cases received on the 
SS Virginia in July, 1934. 

	The vans contained the furniture from the
Aragonese Hall, purchased from Mr. Byne.

	This is the shipment on which the customs
inspector assessed duties on the restored portions of the 
furniture. We protested the assessment of duty and the case
was tried before the Customs Court by Mr. Costello of Mr. 
Neylan's office.

	Trusting this is the information you desire
and with kindest regards, 

	Yours truly
	Julia Morgan
