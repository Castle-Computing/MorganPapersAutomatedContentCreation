Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverdale Drive,
New York, N. Y.,

Dear Mr. Hearst,-

I do not like to take up small troubles at long distances as conditions sometimes 
change before the problem even can reach you.  However, this may not.  Mr. Webb began 
doing queer things shortly after you left - ending in his quarreling with all the men 
and after a scuffle claiming his "honor" was damaged, went to San Luis Obispo and 
had a sheriff come up and arrest several of the boys.  A couple of days later he went 
to a hospital in San Luis Obispo claiming serious injury to his neck.  Dr. Shields 
called me up and said both X-rays and a thorough examination showed no sign of injury 
but that Mr. Webb was in an excessively nervous state, and that the trouble appeared 
to be mental rather than physical.  A few hours later Dr. Lowell, his regular 
physician, reported the same condition saying he wanted to warn me that Mr. Webb 
was not in a mental state to handle men.  After thinking it over, I asked both doctors 
if it would be treating Mr. Webb fairly to consider him ill and insist on his taking a 
vacation until your return.  Their answer was yes, there was really nothing else to do.

The trouble takes the form of his believing himself the subject of conspiracies and 
persecutions - and of attacks on his "honor" and a series of queer schemings such as 
soaking his green house beds in furnace oil, to make the discharging of the men seem 
reasonable, etc.

It may be that a few weeks of lifted responsibility will bring him out all right.  
In the meantime the garden is being cared for and Mr. McClure will look after checking 
of pay rolls etc. until you return.

One reason I write is because he is naturally aggrieved at being suspended, and claims 
that as he is directly responsible to you, no one has a right to interfere, - a fact, 
of course, under ordinary circumstances.  Will this arrangement do until you return?

Yours very truly,

JM-M
