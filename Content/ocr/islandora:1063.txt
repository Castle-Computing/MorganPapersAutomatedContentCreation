Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Riverside Drive,
New York, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you for the very kind letter of December 31, which was late in reaching here; also for the addition plates.

The plates from Arte Y Decoracion En Espana are particularly clear and helpful ones.  I have photographs of nearly all of the more important San Diego Exposition work in one form of another.  Two years ago work took me down to San Diego very frequently and I know the buildings well. The composition and decoration are certainly well handled indeed, but I question whether this type of decoration would not seem too heavy and clumsy on our buildings, we have a comparatively small group, and it would seem to me that they should charm by their detail rather than overwhelm by more or less clumsy exuberance.

I feel just as you do about the early California Mission style as being too primitive to be gone back to and copied.  Charming as they are in mass and color, I believe their appeal their appeal is because of their simple, direct expression of their object.  As I wrote you in my last letter; I believe we could get something really very beautiful by using the combination of Ronda Towers and the Sevilla doorway, with your Virgin over it and San Simeon and San Christophe on either side.  This would allow for great delicacy and at the same time, brilliance in the decoration, and I see how it could be executed without running into very great expense.  It would be a delight to get all the balustrades each beautiful in itself.  I am so glad we do not have to rush them through for this summer.

Now as to the cottages:  You were correct in thinking I did not mean in the location sketches to show the detail of the houses. Buy this you will have received some other sketches of exteriors as modified by various ideas of cornice and use. There are reasons why I too, like the gable on your house.  It recalls, in a pleasant way, the middle gable of the main building, but it does not lend itself happily to the new cornice suggestions.  I will try again and send you some more sketches; in fact, I will write you an illustrated
lLetter on Sunday with all the pros and cons.

As regards buying the big grille door and the window grilles, if the door appeals to you especially, we could undoubtedly use it, but I believe we had better make our own regas grilles, as then we could have them just exactly the size and style we need.

Have you any special idea as to the mantels in the alcoves of your sitting room, or shall I make you up some sketches when I see the material you have sent.

If the "Soldiers of Fortune" is being shown anywhere around here, I will certainly go to it.

Very Truly yours,
