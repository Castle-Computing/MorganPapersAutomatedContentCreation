THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF BOWLING ALLEY INTRUDES UPON THE SPACE OCCUPIED BY THE BIG 
OAK TREE RECENTLY REMOVED THIS TREE HAS BEEN SET BACK BY MOVING AND THEN THE PRUNING 
AND I BELIEVE ANY FURTHER SETBACK WOULD SURELY KILL IT CONSEQUENTLY WE WILL HAVE TO
 DEVISE SOME CANTILEVER METHOD OF GETTING IN A FOUNDATION AT THIS POINT STOP WE CAN 
 CUT AWAY THE CEMENT COVERING OF THIS TREE ROOT AREA BUT I WOULD NOT DARE ENCROACH ON 
 THE ACTUAL ROOT AREA HOW WILL WE GET THE ENGINEER TO SUPPLY THE NECESSARY DESIGN WILL
  YOU SEND IT TO US I DO NOT WANT TO POUR THIS WALL UNTIL WE HAVE IT 2 WILL YOU KINDLY 
  SEND A TREE SURGEON DOW TO MAKE NECESSARY SUPPORTS FOR LIMBS OF OAKS THAT NEED SUPPORT
   MR ROSSI SAYS HE CAN DETERMINE ACCURATELY WITH INSTRUMENTS THE LEVEL OF TERRACES 
   AROUND NEW WING AND MAKE SURE TO HAVE THEM SAME LEVEL STOP UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES
    SHALL HE POUR THE TERRACE SOUTHWEST OF TENNIS COURT AND THE ESPLANADE
