Dear Mr. Hearst:

The warehouses at San Simeon are full, and cannot house from now on more than 
incidental packages-

For this reason I selected out from the very fine objects of the 59th carload just 
arriving only objects which can be directly placed in the houses, (some you have 
indicated plans for) and have asked Mr. Minott to put the remainder of the shipment 
in your space at the Stringer warehouse-I will bring the photos of these articles to 
you next visit for your further instructions.

I was at the Hill Monday-Mr. Rossi is back, but weak, and conditions were such, I asked 
him to do things that would not tax him such as getting into shape physically, moving 
his office, catching up his files, planning his tree moving etc, but not taking charge 
again until the first of the month-

There are many details to carry to a finish, and the few men working are fully employed, 
and except for the too good weather, things seemed to be in proper shape-

As always
Yours truly,
