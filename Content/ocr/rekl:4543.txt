My dear Miss Morgan:

Please note the big Mohammedan jar in the January 26-29 sale at Anderson's, catalogue of which is being sent to you. That should be put in a good place, as it is valuable and rare and good to look at-- possibly on the lowest terrace of house C where the seats are around it at the retaining wall. It is No. 778.

Or, if something more sightly from a distance should be put here then the jar should go at the entrance of house C or at the beginning of the steps downward to house C. I think it should be associated with house C and the Moorish character of that house.

 2. The fountain opposite the court of house A is not particularly interesting and inasmuch as we have some very good pieces of statuary now, it occurred to me that it might be well to put one of them there.

I think the most suitable one would be the Galatea which I think has been already delivered West in the car shipment to SanFrancisco. This is really excellent work and shows Galatea on the back of a dolphin. The dolphin could easily be made into a fountain, and this piece opposite the court of house A would be much more striking I think than the little fountain of the children we now have there. 

Perhaps you may have in mind some other location for this Galatea that will be more conspicuous, however. It might be the fountain for the big pool in the middle of the central plaza. Will you kindly let me know about this.

3. I have altogether three sarcophagi. There is the Byzantine one for house C; then there is another sarcophagus that I got at the Yerkes sale, about the same size, maybe a shade larger-- early Roman. And the third sarcophagus is a very big and very fine one,which cost me $10,000 and for which I have been offered $15,000 by the Detroit Museum.

I want to put this last one in a very good place, I think on one of the terraces of house A. here again, however, you might have a better location in mind.

Will you let me know about these things and oblige,

Sincerely yours,
