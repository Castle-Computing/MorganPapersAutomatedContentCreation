Feb. 4, 1933.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Loorz informs us you are anxious to have him start some of the inside work, 
principally the billiard room and south duplexes.

As you know, we carried a heavy crew up to the first of January in order to finish 
the pool and some of the other jobs, with the hope of having until about April first 
to pay for back work.

As our January allowance was reduced from $20,000 to $15,000 we cannot undertake much 
of a program and still make headway at catching up.  However, if the $20,000 allowance 
could be maintained, we can carry on the above inside work - at least with a small crew.

Will you please advise how much of a program you wish to follow, obliging

Very truly yours,

Julia Morgan
