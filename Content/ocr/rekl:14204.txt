December 2, 1924.

Mrs. William Randolph Hearst,
South Cuesta Escantada
San Simeon,  California.

Dear Mrs. Hearst:

Waiting for me in the office this morning was our sculpture man, Mr. Miletin, with a bowl he had cut out of California blue onyx for you as appreciation for Mr. Hearst's kindness to him.

He is shy about it and asked me to write this note for him.

With kindest regards,

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
