HEARTILY APPROVE YOUR PLAN THINK IT WOULD BE STILL FURTHER IMPROVED BY SHORTENING SITTING ROOM OF HOUSE B ON COURT SIDE ABOUT FIVE OR SIX FEET AND MAKING LOBBY SIMILAR TO THAT IN HOUSE A ABOUT FORTY FEET LONG AND TEN FEET WIDE MADE UP OF THIS SPACE FROM SITTING ROOM PORCH SPACE AND SPACE NOW OCCUPIED BY TWO LITTLE CORRIDORS AT EACH SIDE ALL THROWN INTO ONE IF YOU 
PREFER YOU COULD KEEP TWO LITTLE CORRIDORS SEPARATE BUT THERE WOULD NO ENTRANCE FROM BEDROOMS OR FROM LITTLE CORRIDORS DIRECTLY INTO SITTING ROOM ALL ENTRANCESWOULD BE INTO LOBBY AND THEN THROUGH CENTRAL DOOR INTO SITTING ROOM ENTRACE DOORS WOULD OPEN INTO LOBBY SITTING ROOM DOOR WOULD OPEN FROM MIDDLE OF IT IF YOU APPROVE PROCEED WITH THIS
