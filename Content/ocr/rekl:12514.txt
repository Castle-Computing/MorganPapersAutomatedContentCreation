Dear Mr. Hearst:

This is a report as to the fountains.  The marble of the lower basins is completely done and has arrived on the Hill, but not set up.  

One House A big bowl is about complete and one about two-thirds done.  They are of beautiful marble and the lines and ornament I think you will like.  One bowl had to be made twice as a flaw was found in the very heart of the marble block.  The upper members are all well along.  We would like to know the size of the bases of the Jean de Bolougne's figures in order to have the last members of proper size to receive them.

The House c big bowl is all done but finishing tow of the heads forming spouts -- and the small bowl is completely done -- very pretty, too.  There is a naive and childlike point of view in Miletin that is exasperating in a business way, but has its recompenses.  The one lion done, is practically a copy of the mother lion on the upper fountains  The other three are blocked out, but not finished,  the idea being to have each lion different in detail, using the copied one "landward", as being less seen.

Miletin says he can polish the marble in place to whatever surface you wish, so am having it all sent up hone finish -- also any retouching you might like he will do in place.

If the weather hold good the prospects are for shipping all up this month.  the fountains look very large and fine in the workshop -- now the interesting thing will be to see how much the Hill will dwarf them.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
