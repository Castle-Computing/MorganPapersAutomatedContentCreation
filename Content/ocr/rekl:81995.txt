Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Rossi told me of your directions to go ahead and finish the tennis courts - and on 
coming back here I sent up the head of the firm handling the "Lakold" to fill the voids 
left on taking out the wood marking strips Mr. Rossi put in last year in the concrete 
half of the court.  He reported that the concrete (a surface slab not the roof slab 
proper) was so shot to pieces by the trips that he strongly advised taking it up and 
replacing with Lakold.  Also that the material they laid last winter had shrunk in 
thickness considerably due to the use of the local beach (i.e. salty) sand.

On thinking it over I asked Mr. Rossi to stop off any more preparatory work, and sent
 for the Los Angeles firm who did the actual work at the Beach house.  They had been 
 unwilling on account of a trade agreement as to territory to do the work last year, 
 although agreeing with the local firm to come up and put on the green to coat.

I asked them for a full report on what they considered necessary to do to make just as 
fine a job as the Beach courts and the figure they would contract to do it for.

I saw them in Los Angeles Saturday afternoon, and intended to give you this explanation
 and the enclosed papers Tuesday. They say if you contract with them, it will take
  (for the courts) two weeks after getting the material onto the job to finish the 
  two courts, but that they could have one done in ten days.

The cost according to their bid is about 40Â¢ per sq. ft. and the work would be 
guaranteed, and also "serviced" for two years without extra pay.

If you think well of this, the San Francisco firm will turn over to the Los Angeles 
firm their part of the material and there will be no complication.

Yours very truly,
