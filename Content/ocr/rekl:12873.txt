Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Hearst Camp,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is a print of the floor plan of House B, practically up to date.  Your telegram regarding extra rooms under this and the other houses has just been received.. I will make the sketches you ask.

Yours very truly,
