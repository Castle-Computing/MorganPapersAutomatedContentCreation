Dear Miss Morgan:

I am glad you like the little temple.  It occurs to me that there will be some rearrangement of your garden plan because of it.

for instance, I think there should be a little space in front of it with flagstone paving like the space at the other sid of the rose garden.

I should think there might be a semicircular bench in front of it, or at least two segments of a semicircular bench with an approach between.

In other words, the temple will be a point of interest and people are likely to assemble in front of it to a certain extent.

The plans of the garden that you sent me is exceedingly good as long as we do not have the temple; but with the temple you will probably want to revise your plan.

I think best, in view of your letters, to time my arrival at the ranch for the latter part of August.

sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
