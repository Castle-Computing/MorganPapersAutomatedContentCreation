December 3, 1923.

Mr.William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y>

Dear Mr. Hearst:

By registered mail are two sketches showing Ariadne in the pool and at the terrace lee.  The enclosed photograph is about in correct scale.

In the same package is a suggestion for treatment of the little south side terrace of House A.  In marble to match the group it would cost about $650.00 - in stone about $200.00 less.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
