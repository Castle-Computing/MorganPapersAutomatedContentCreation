September 11, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Saturday and Sunday were spent at San Simeon, - Saturday on general work, and Sunday 
going over the replanting of the torn up areas.  The four big cypresses are planted on 
"C" Terrace, also two of the four cypresses below the Neptune Terrace.  They certainly 
have an air!  The shovel is out of the Gymnasium" and at work excavating the balance of
 the space under the tennis courts.  This week will see all rough concrete about the 
 Main Building plaza, earrings, etcetera completed.  Work is begun on breaking up the 
 concrete ring about the moved oak, - grading, etcetera in this area being under way. 
 You did not expect the new terrace between House "B" and the Cross Axe to be put in at 
 this time?

Below, Mr. Rossi is getting the forms in for the secondary stairway between the Neptune 
Terrace and lower "B" Terrace.

Work on the road to Burnett will be stopped at the creek, so as to have the use of this 
number of men on the more pressing items, as you suggested we might do.  The animal men
 wanted more improvements at the arena, so that the giraffe house was not started as per
  last schedule quoted you.  The new arena seems a great improvement with its sun 
  parlors for each animal, as well as the central play ground for use of each in turn.

The new chef is picturesque, seems to be a good cook, (although I am not a competent 
judge) -- and I believe will prove economical, in that Mr. Slattery and Mrs. O'Brien 
will be able to set up a new wage scale for the household with her reasonable salary as
 the peak and in that her natural French viewpoint is careful.

Yours very truly,
