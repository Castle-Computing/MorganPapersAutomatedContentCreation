Dear Miss Morgan:

I am handling you, herewith, two prints of Sheet No. 1, showing cutting lists of 
reinforcing steel for the reconstruction of the Outdoor Swimming Pool at San Simeon, 
as submitted by Soule Steel Company.  Both of these have been approved as to general 
correctness.

Very sincerely,

s/ W.L. Huber
