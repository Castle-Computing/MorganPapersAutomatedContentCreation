Dear Miss Morgan:

Here is a mantel I did not know I had.  It seems exactly the right mantel for the big refactory, but will necessitate considerable changes in our arrangements there.

The smaller Gothic, with the angels, can go in one of the twins rooms.  It is quite fine I think.

Mr. Willicombe has apparently not yet found the photographs of the mantels which we had out here and intended to be in the upper Gothic rooms.  I enclose some others.

I don't seem to be able to find the photographs you gave me last year, including the photograph of the big Gothic mantel.  Still more important, I don't seem to be able to find the mantel, though I know we ordered it from Daquin in Paris, and I think he got it from Baceri, or Storrar or DeMotte.

I am sending you photographs of the mantels that we have and of which you probably already possess photographs.  There are some others, particularly three from DeMotte, purchased last year and which Mr. Willicombe says arrived from abroad recently.  I shall have photographs made of these.

Sincerely yours,

s/W.R. Hearst
