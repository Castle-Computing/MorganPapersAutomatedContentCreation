Dear Miss Morgan:

Will you please keep available these pictures of the type of pool they have in Southern France.
  I think some day we might want to have something of this kind at the point at San Simeon.  
  (See pages enclosed marked A and A-1)

2.  We bought these windows, as you probably know.  (See photos enclosed marked No. 1, No. 2,
 No. 3)

3.  We also bought this one.  (See photo marked No. -4) That is the one for the upper window 
that you said you did not have a picture of.

4.  Here are two nice doorways,-- if you have any use for them.  (See enclosed letter from
 Mitchell Samuels and blueprint and photograph attached.)

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco.
