Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. McGregor telegraphs:

Spanish wooden door measurements are -- Height over all 10'4".  Width over all 5'6 ".  Inside measurements are -- Height 6'6". Width 2'11"."

Mr Hearst instructs me to tell you he contemplates using this in rear of the big house.

--------

Answering your letter of the 23rd on finances -- Mr. Hearst instructs me to ask that you arrange for deferred payment so as to stretch them over as long a period as possible.

"There is  a distinct objection to paying out a lot of money this fall," Mr. Hearst says, "as I have commitment for a lot of other things and do not naturally want to run taxes too high."

Mr. Hearst is glad to note Mr. Rossi's curtailment of expenses and is confident that you will be able to arrange so as to keep with the month allotment, especially as cutting down sharply later would enable you to make care of these deferred payments within the year.

Sincerely
s/J Willicombe
Secretary to Mr. Hearst

P-S  Mr. Hearst also says that "we want to make it as comfortable and pleasant for Mr. Webb and Mr. Keep as we can -- keep them satisfied and happy -- as he would not want t lose either one of them." This has special reference to their living quarters.
