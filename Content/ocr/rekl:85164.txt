Dear Mr. Hearst:

A forty foot wide room would eliminate nearly all the big oaks -- so that if the 
"Sovereignceil" is only twenty feet wide, perhaps we could make a somewhat narrower 
room - as the interruption at the center would make it seem wider.

As son as the photographs arrive, w will start sketches using different combinations 
of "Sovereignceil" with material you have here.  I think you have just the right 
thing, if the character is right.

My understanding is that you ordered the Alcantara stone vaulted ceilings, but not
 the Cloister vaulting, which was thought not available. I know Mr. Byne for some 
 reason does not know what you finally decided as regards these ceilings.  Probably
  a cable restating the order would be good.  A letter recently sounded as though 
  he was more than usually troubled by the uncertainties of Spanish relationships.

The Chimes Master from Berkeley will go to the Hill with me for Saturday.  He can
 pass on the bells being in tone and perhaps offer some suggestions to overcome 
 the sounds from the operating devices being too evident form the Plaza.

Yours truly
