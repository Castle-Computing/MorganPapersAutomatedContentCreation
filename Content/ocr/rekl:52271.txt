Dear Miss Morgan:

I am sorry I was so sleepy headed the last night you were at the ranch.  I think I did not say anything very consistently, but what I have in mind is this:

Mr. Joy and Mr. Rossi think that they can finish the gymnasium and the terrace and walls on the C side and the south wing of the main building by the holidays.

Internally they think they might finish the whole Gothic floor by the same time.  That means putting the present suite in a little more complete condition, with the doors fitted and the hardware applied and all such details attended to, and that also means finishing the study and bedroom and bathrooms across the hall.

I would like to do that much if we can. Will you please urge them to do it.

2.  I don't want to undertake much during January and February, because the weather is generally so bad as to make the work unnecessarily expensive.  We might, however, do the concrete work on the B wall and on the north wing.  Concrete work can be done in pretty wet weather.

3.  During March, April and May, I would like to complete the north wall and build the terrace rooms and finish everything around the pool ready for the colonnade when it comes.  I hope that all this is possible.  I think it is if we continue to make progress.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
