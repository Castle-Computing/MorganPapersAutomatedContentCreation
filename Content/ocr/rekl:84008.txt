Dear Mr. Hearst,-

The last forms are being taken down from the new Wing Towers, and Mr. Rossi is about 
ready to pour the various steps from North Terrace to esplanade and walls and cypress 
tree boxes on this level, also the continuation of the cypress tree boxes along the 
roadway,- this work being done now as Mrs. Hearst and guest wanted the use of the 
tennis court and theatre until the end of this month.  The theatre is ready for 
plastering and Dien and John Van der Loo are casting the big caryatids.  The new 
tower and roof rooms have presented construction and architectural problems, now 
worked out, and this framing is also under way.  I think this unit is going to add 
greatly to the looks of the Main Building especially as seen from the hogback, as 
from this side the new "tower" will not count as such, but as a part of the mass of 
the Main Building. A way also developed to get from the Gothic Study to the new stair 
case, if you approve the idea.

Yesterday I took George's new areo-taxi at 6:45 AM, inspected his house in passing 
Hillsborough, and landed in a field near the Jolon buildings before ten o'clock.  
It was warm, 112Â° inside the big room.  The plane left there at 12:45, and after 
getting that long coveted airplane picture first hand around the Hill top, landed in 
your San Simeon airport just 23 minutes later.  It seems incredible!  The plane passed 
directly over the Red Butte, and circled over the new chicken layout which looked very 
neat and trim.  After putting in an intensive afternoon on the Hill, the "taxi" 
dropped me at the San Francisco field at 8:15 PM.  It made a full day - I am not quite 
sure as to the wisdom of repeating it - but it was well worth while this once.

Hoping your trip is a happy one,

Sincerely,
