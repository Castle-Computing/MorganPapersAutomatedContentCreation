Dear Mr. Joy:

Here are some memoranda, in case I forget any of them.

Miss Morgan suggests inclosing the loggia of House A. I think this should be done and I will show you how I think it should be done.  We can talk over the details with Miss Morgan.

I think as soon as we get through with the south terrace to the east of House A, we should develop the south terrace to the west of A in what Miss Morgan calls the ear ring shape.

I also think we should promptly put in the stairs on the east side of the new south terrace going up to the esplanade.

Sincerely yours,

W.R. Hearst
