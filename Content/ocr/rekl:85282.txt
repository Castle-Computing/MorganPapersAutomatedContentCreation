Dear Mr. Hearst:

Am very much obliged for the big mantel photographs.

If you could have included the moulded stone on either side, it would provide for patching 
and for work that may develop around our own flanking doorways.

The drawings are shaping up for your next visit.

Work is going along steadily on the Hill according to program.  The mantel is in place in 
the new Celestial Sitting room and work progressing on this room's ceiling.

The bath rooms can be usable any time, but are not completed - so many small items each of 
a different craft and of necessary sequence.  However, they promise to be well worth the effort.

Yours truly,
