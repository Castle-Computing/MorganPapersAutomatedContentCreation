Dear Miss Morgan:

I think the slate floor would probably go better in the Gothic lobby.  I have not had any very definite idea on the subject, but I believe that would be the most suitable place; in which case, we would probably use either marble or travertine for the library lobby.

I have not any particular preference.

I suppose marble would be a little more sumptuous, especially as we are using travertine for the cloister halls outside, and also for the porch in front of the library.

Let us say marble then for the library lobby; and slate for the Gothic lobby.

There remains then to be decided the material for the Gothic parlor and two bedrooms, and for the study and bedroom on the other side of the lobby.

Doubtless wood would be best for the study and bedroom on the east side of the lobby, as I know you are anxious to keep weight off this part of the house.

We can use travertine for the Gothic parlor and two bedrooms.  We can easily put rugs on top of thw travertine.

If you think travertine is too refined, we can use slate in this parlor and two bedrooms; but I rather think the travertine would be better.  In the towers we could use travertine or slate, just as you think best.  Here again I think travertine might be better.  This leaves the only place where we use slate the gothic lobby; wood or travertine for the study and bedroom;  travertine for the Gothic parlor and two bedrooms; travertine for the towers; and marble for the library lobby.
