Dear Miss Morgan:

I would like to enlarge the small winding stairs to tower rooms all possible.  
I advise at least two feet diameter.  This would greatly dignify the tower rooms 
and increase convenience.

2.  Please remember the additional lights on lamps in breakfast room, or else 
clusters at ceiling as in Gothic bedrooms.

3.  Also curtains in Gothic sitting room.  I advise larger globes and more of 
them in Gothic sitting room lanterns.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

All taken care of
