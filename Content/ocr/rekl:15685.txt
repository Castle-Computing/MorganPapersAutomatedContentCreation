Dear Miss Morgan:

Whenever you ship anything to us down here from the ranch pleas use the services of Bakins storage and warehouse people of Los Angeles.  They have wonderfully good trucks, adapted to this business, and they are conscientious and careful.

I think when we find a firm of this kind we ought always to patronize them and not allow these haphazard people to break our things.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
