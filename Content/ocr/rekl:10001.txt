Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As telegraphed, I am getting out the garage and kitchen drawing in form for the contractors to big on, if possible, without their having to go to San Simeon.  This has made it necessary taking accurate grades on the site, and it will be several days before these will be here.

I realize that it has not been economical trying to operate during the winter months, as too much time is lost trying to haul and handle material and men in the wet--the trucks requiring constant repairs and all the camp items being much more expensive than in good weather.  The first two winters on the hill were comparatively good, but California never experienced such a winter as this last one.

So far, the several contractors spoken to, have objected to figuring on account of the time needed to visit the work both before submitting g a figure, and in the course of construction--(Not taking kindly to my proposed schedule).  All suggested their being allowed to do the work on a commission basis of from 10% to 15% depending on the total amount involved.  I will do my best to get at least three straight competitive bids, as on a commission basis there might be all the old troubles with new added.

Before starting the kitchen wing, I had hoped you would see the site without the oak, lost this winter, and with the concrete 
pavement of the "plaza" in, as you might think it advisable to move the main building back some what.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
