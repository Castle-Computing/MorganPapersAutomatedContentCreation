December 18, 1922

Mr. William Randolph Hearst.
137 Riverside drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This photograph is taken looking toward the tank-house from the southwest corner of the mezzanine, the concrete hoist being longside the refectory.

Since taken, the mezzanine floor has been poured.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
