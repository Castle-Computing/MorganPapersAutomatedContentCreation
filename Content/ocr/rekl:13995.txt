Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Ambassador Hotel, Los Angeles, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Rossi forwarded us your check for $5000 on the special fund for labor on the hill.

After the financial talk in July, it was explained to each of those to whom was owed any considerable sum that through no fault of yours, but a misunderstanding on my part, I had gone much over our monthly building account allowance, and would need time to catch up -- in general getting a sixty day extension with interest thereafter.

Last month we made very little savings with which to pay back bills as materials, etc. was urgently needed.  If we cut to the "moving limit" to carry on with, it will take until May to regain normal.

So far this month we have had $5000 from Mr. Bogart and your special $5000.  The $20000 you intended to allow us in July to help on the marble and plumbing bills was not received.

I cannot order new material to any extent until we pay up to an appreciable degree - which means either waiting until we can catch up from account funds, or else having a lump sum advance.

We have in large items about 425000 on contracts for teak sash, frames, glass, etc. for the hundred and more openings of the main building, about the same sum on plumbing, piping, etc. - $7500 on marble, and about $12000 on kitchen wing items.

I would say in fairness to myself, that I did "give warning" last spring that it would not be possible to push the main building work faster than we were going on the regular allowance and approximately the amount that would be needed this fall.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
