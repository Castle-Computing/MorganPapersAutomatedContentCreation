Dear Mr. Hearst:

The enclosed photographs were made in  the office from the first rough set-up of the model made with the latest dimensions sent you.  Please don't examine the detail, especially the little tower tops Miss Mesick could not catch.

An still putting all efforts on the necessary working drawings, and then, those off, will make your â€˜set-ups" one after another, of the rooms, external details, etc.

Yours sincerely,

JM-deM
