Dear Mr. Hearst:

Am just back from two days at San Simeon -- needing time to watch men "pulling together" such things as the upper and lower bodies of the hairy men and otherwise "antiquing" the stone of the main entrance.  Miss Worn was thinning the geranium-lantana border herself, so as to fix the idea in the gardener's eye.  Also Mr. Meyberg was there, planning out the work for two of his most experienced workmen.  The stone facing is going up and the work generally is being concentrated on in the order of the program you approved.  It is hard to hold everyone to this -- but by steady forcing it is working out.

The housekeeper is solving the "care of antiques" problem, understands and cares about them, and also seems to get on well with the workmen involved.

The roses were at their prime, really most lovely, and I regret greatly you could not see them.

Things generally are in good shape.

Yours very truly,

Enclosed are some Gymnasium photographs.
