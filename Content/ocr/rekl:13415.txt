[Letter]

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday I had a treat seeing those magnificent new tapestries.  I am wondering if they are to go in the refectory.  I have ordered rollers for them as they are badly creased.  And the stained glass is this for the refectory also?

[Margin Notes]
I don't quite understand about this.  Will you kindly send me photographs of the glass and tapestries.  May be something has been sent West that belongs here separately as we have been hunting for some glass.

Is the set of choir stalls. (photographs enclosed) intended for the wainscot of the social room -- I find on measuring it up that it is too high for the tapestries.  Would you consider using your other set (enclosed)?  The originals in either case could not go far toward covering the space.  The ceiling of this room is G-R-E-A-T.

[Margin Notes]

I am glad the ceiling is fine.  I am trying to get enough stalls of one kind to almost cover the (?) I have two sets of stalls now nearly alike and I am trying to get a third.

The two fine curtains received recently are for the arch between the Hall and refectory?  The could be enlarged with a plain border of velvet and lined.

All Right

We have been working on the refectory ceiling drawings for months and have roll after roll of little figures, etc.  A recent calculation as to how much longer it would take to finish them showed work for 214 uninterrupted days!!  When I said last summer we could get this ceiling up ready for the decorators, it was before the idea developed of putting all the little figures, and decorations generally, in relief (low).  In the long run this would probably be the most effective, best, and quickest, but it is evident that the ceiling could not be completed this summer except by putting a great many modelers on it, --- which has dangers given the character to be attained.

[Margin Notes]

I don't mind the ceiling not being completed this summer but I am alarmed at the labor and cost of it.  My thought is to try to get a genuine old ceiling if we are to put that much money into it or if we want to do something less expensive why not try an elaborately grained coat stain ceiling with (?) in rosettes like these real ones I sent from France.  We could use polychrome throughout the effect and the hall would be very gothic and in harmony with the stairs (?)  What would the difference in expense be.  Would it go with our intentions?
