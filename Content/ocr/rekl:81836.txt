Will be at San Simeon Monday stop Would like to see pergola studies stop Think Pergola too far down hill stop It should start from crest of little knoll to West of where it begins and keep a contour level all the way around to Persian Hill and beyond to the axis of long stairway stop This level higher up will be much easier and cheaper to construct and will also make better job I think Pergola at present level would be too expensive for me to undertake stop At the upper level Pergola will be easier to reach both from West and from Persian Hill.
