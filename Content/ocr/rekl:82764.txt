Dear Miss Morgan:

I am not very well satisfied with the young architect that is here.  I would greatly 
like to have a more competent man on this job as your representative.

Furthermore I would greatly like to have a representative of Mr. Huber down here.  I am 
perfectly willing to pay the salaries of these people.

I think it would be much better for the system on the hill and much better for me, as 
far as progress is concerned, and I should think it would be better for you, too, 
relieving you of a lot of detail and a lot of delay.

When you are not here, and when we have no one representing you that I can confer with 
or have confidence in, I am asked about things that I know very little about, and I do 
not like to make decisions except on general matters.

Still, if there is not somebody here that I can confer with and who can attend to 
necessary details, things are likely to be constructed and then torn down; and that 
means delay and expense.

When we are working a great many men, as we are at present, we proceed very rapidly 
and there are not always plans at hand for the construction that we can do.  If we had 
some man as good as Mr. Joy, and a competent representative from Mr. Huber's office, 
we could keep ahead of construction with plans which cover all essentials.

The arrangement I propose seems practical and surely it would be convenient.

There is some delay now on account of the north terrace.  There were no definite and 
detailed plans covering steel placement.  Mr. Rossi placed the steel one way; Mr. 
Huber's office seems to think he was right; the young man who is here seems to think he 
was wrong.  That means we will have to wait until you arrive.

I feel reasonably sure that Huber's office is right, but in view of the young 
architect's having a different opinion, I do not want to run any risks; so we will have 
to wait until you arrive on the scene.

If we had the system as I suggest in operation I think we would always have detailed
 plans, approved by your architectural representative and your engineering 
 representative; and if we did not have detailed plans we could lay off men and wait 
 without cost until we had detailed plans sufficiently in advance.

I do not think an architect and an engineer would cost any more than the two architects
 we had for awhile, and if they did cost more, what is the difference?

This is a big work and justifies a big organization.

P-S  Thank you for your note and photographs which I will hold until you come to ranch.  
Chief says he would like these things shipped to the warehouse in San Simeon for use 
when we have opportunity in this neck of the woods.  At the same time he may want other 
things on your list of modern stuff sent here.  Anyway if you will mention it when you 
are here I will ask him.  Thanks for your prompt reply.
