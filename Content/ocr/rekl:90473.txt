Dear Mr. Willicombe:

The leakes are due to not having the 
finish coverings, stone, cast stone, tile, etc., 
on walls and roofs -- or in and about windows, etc.  
Moreover, in order to apply the finish, our concrete 
has to be left rough and have the form wires 
left in, in order to provide proper bonding.

The type of cement advertised is too 
quick setting for our type of work. In the first 
pool at the Beach House, the contractors used this 
cement, Mr. Flannery not realizing the importance of 
having the specifications followed, and you will 
remember the pool walls disintegrated -- probably due 
to the high heat generated in the initial setting.

As always,

Yours truly,
