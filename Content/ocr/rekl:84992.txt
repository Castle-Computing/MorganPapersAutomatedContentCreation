Dear Miss Morgan:

With mingled feelings I must inform you that I intend, - and herewith do, tender my 
resignation to take effect at your early convenience.

I am fully aware of your good will towards - and confidence in me, for which I extend 
to you my sincerest thanks and appreciation.

In regards the unfinished job at Jolon: 

I have made a planting plan by which our Stanley Heaton will be quite capable of 
finishing the work to be done there.

I beg to remain most respectfully yours,
