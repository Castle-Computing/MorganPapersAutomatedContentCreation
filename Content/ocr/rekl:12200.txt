Dear Miss Morgan:

I have now both the drawing you sent abroad and the ones you sent direct to me here, I like the basement layout very much and appreciate the value of having the different parts of the basement separated by fireproof walls.

I understand that you prefer to make the building three feet longer and to get direct access to the rear stairs through the passage.  This seems to me a more practical arrangement and I am satisfied with it if the grill will look as well that way, and I imagine it will look quite as well, maybe better than in the other place.

The second floor arrangements are quite satisfactory -- library, lobby, the small rooms and the rear suite.

I do not like the entrance from the sitting room of the rear suite into the bedroom with the columns; it does not make the bedroom secluded enough, I prefer the small single door entrance as indicated on the south side.

The loggia should be very pretty as you have arranged it.

As I will be out West the latter part of this month, I do not suppose it is necessary to go into any further detail at present.

Sincerely,
WR Hearst
