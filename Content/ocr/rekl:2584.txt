Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Birge does everything for me in New York.  He is out here and has seen the houses and thinks they are wonderful.

I asked him to see you and see the decoration schemes if you please.  Mr. Birge has exceptionally good ideas and perhaps a talk with him would develop something that you and I have not thought of.  Please talk particularly about the schemes of decoration.  He will tell you all we have done in New York.  Perhaps some could be adapted .  At any rate I think an exchange of ideas between two such able people will be good and interesting to  both.  Dont you think so.

Sincerely, 
s/ W R Hearst
