Dear Miss Morgan,
I have been thinking what to do with that Neptune fountain. We ought to use it somewhere. I don't want too many decolet√©e ladies around the grounds and gentlemen as a rule aren't interesting. This Neptune fountain though not beautiful is quaint, and although the nymphs are not over attired the dominant figure is an elderly gentleman with whiskers who lends respectability to the landscape for those at least who don't know his record.
There are several places where this Neptune fountain might be placed with a shell behind him although he is covered all the way round but not very finely. First where we have  considered - below B facing the mountains. Second below B as the lower terminal of the terrace we are now making facing the house. This would be good place except somehow he ought to be on the ocean side of the hill. Third below C at the lower and end of [that?] terrace where the seat now is andfacing the house. This is a pretty good place as far as appropriateness goes. He is partly at least on the ocean side and he is in harmony with the quaint character of C. Fourth below A in a specially constructed of extension of the middle part of the terrace facing the big doors. Fifth at the end of the walk and steps which descend from the Morgan well towards the bath house. He would correspond to the Flora bench on the other side of the hill. Sixth in the bath house Seventh in the rear court or patio of the big house or on the side of the big house. You said you wanted a big [illeg.] there now that there are no lower windows to the refectory. Which of all these do you think best? I think I will get him. We can use him somewhere.
Sincerely,
W R Hearst
