Dear Miss Morgan:

In looking at the models of the center house, the facade seems a little bit elaborate, especially on either side of the entrance door.

I know that these models are not accurate, however, and possible the designs do not contemplate so much elaboration.

There is also in the model a  good deal of elaboration on the four small towers.  Perhaps, this also is not contemplated -- at least not to such an extent.  I think this excess of ornament gives the towers more of a Portuguese effect than Spanish.  I never have like the elaboration of Portuguese decoration.

I think rather plain surfaces against which a few decorative members stand out strongly have the best effect for our kind of architecture; in face, we have employed just those methods on the houses already built.

Sincerely yours,
