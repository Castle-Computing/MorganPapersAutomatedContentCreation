Dear Mr. Joy
I would like some lanterns hung in the lobby of the gothic suite. Surely two and possibly four can be hung there.
I think these (and other) [lanterns?] should be made to look well. When they are rusty they should be gilded on painted-antiqued of course but not left rusty and rugged looking.
Have we any more ironstandards, Did we send a lot to Wyntoon and what became of them. Perhaps some of them can be saved from the wreckage.
