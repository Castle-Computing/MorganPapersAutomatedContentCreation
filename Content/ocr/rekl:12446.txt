MR WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEART
137 RIVERSIDE DRIVE NEW YORK. N.Y.

ROOFS STOOD FINELY.  IRON STORM SASH LEAKED WHEN IN DIRECT PATH OF STORM.  JOY WATCHED FOR CAUSES WHICH WILL TRY AGAIN TO OVERCOME.  THINK FOR MAIN BUILDING REGULAR SASH OPENING IN AND STORM SASH OPENING OUT WOULD OVERCOME DIFFICULTIES.  WIND DRIVES RAIN UP HILL SO THAT DEVICES AGAINST ORDINARY RAIN ACTUALLY CAUSE TROUBLE.

WOULD YOU WISH EUCALYPTUS PLANTING IN GULLYS BELOW HOUSES TO PROCEED.  TREES WERE RECEIVED AND (?) READY WHEN TELEGRAM TO HOLD WAS RECEIVED.  EARLY STORMS HAVE MADE FINE PLANTING CONDITIONS.
