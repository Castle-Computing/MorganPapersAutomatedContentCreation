Dear Mr. Hearst:

So far I have found three men for "shipping" men with the following qualifications:

1-  A man about 35 years, thoroughly reliable, at present an accountant, but for a number of years a Clerk of Works.  He has had no experience with handling fine materials.

2-  A man about 55, very accurate and painstaking, that we have employed from time to time as an inspector.  Nothing would escape him.

3-  A man in New York now, of about 35, who has had charge for Paul Chaflin of antiques, bookkeeping, and supplies for the Deering estate in Florida. It seems a long way to go for a man but it might pay as he knows the value of fine things and understands the necessity of careful handling.  He is a good bookkeeper and has had years of experience in just this same kind of work. I have known of him for several years and have thought at times of adding him to my office force.  His present salary is $60.00 per week.

If none of these sound promising, I will try again.

Yours very truly,
