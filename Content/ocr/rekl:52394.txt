Dear Mr. Hearst:

The figures from the American marble companies for the colonnade were all for the material erected in place in the colonnades at San Simeon.  The Vermont Marble Company's figure for the marble columns, capitals and bases, only, delivered at San Francisco is $16,850.00.  This may be less than the Italian figure.

Yours very truly,
