Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

1. What would you think of moving the fireplaces in the Royal Suite bedrooms over to between the windows, putting the beds between entrance and bath room doors?  It would seem to offer several advantages and incidentally help out in construction.

2. - The stone arch between the Refectory and Breakfast room is carved both sides on all the top stones, and on one side only of the imposts.  There is not room to put in the sliding door -- and the little doors, if the full 19'-4" of the grille is used, will have almost no support to the eye for the wall above -- unless, it just occurs, we carry the Choir stall as a paneling across to the grille.  -- Someway it does not seem as fine.

What do you think?

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan
