Mr. Willicombe phoned Mr. Hearst asked the following questions and would you please wire 
answers this afternoon to him - Mr. W-- , Ambassador Hotel. L.A. 

1.  	Where is the stained glass window that came broken?

2.  	How badly is it broken?  Will you have a photo of it mailed down.

3.  	Is there anyone here capable of mending it?

4.  	"If not please have the broken pieces carefully packed in cotton in a separate 
box 	and returned."  Mr. W. felt this last question too ambiguous to take as an order 
to 	ship until you hear from him again.  He questioned whether the whole window 	
and pieces or just the pieces to be shipped.
