Dear Mr. Hadley:-
Please comply with the following requirements in all chimneys under construction and alter others later:
1. Please make fireplace opening wide as possible and low as possible so that width will surely exceed height.
2. Make throat full width of fireplace, all the width that you can get.
3. Make throat four inches deep.
4. Make windshelf not less than eight inches deep.
5. Make windshelf flat as shown in diagram.
6. Use dampers of the kind mentioned in article.
7. Make ample smoke chamber as described in article, converging one foot for every three feet in height.
8. Substitute cylindrical for rectangular flues and make the area of base 1/10 (one tenth) the area of the fire place opening as reconstructed.
9. Carry chimneys high as possible.House "A"
These fireplaces are all to be made and must be made from the beginning to conform to the requirements.
Don't brick them in until the openings, throat, windshelf, smoke chamber, flue and everything have been temporarily erected in boards according to the dimensions prescribed in the article.
I want to see these and the ones in the other houses after plans have been fully matured.HOUSE "B"
The fireplaces in the bedrooms must be reconstructed.
1st. There is no smoke chamber and one must be built.
2nd. The fireplace opening of the wooden fireplaces is of proper dimensions but it has been bricked in to make it higher than it is wide. The marble and brick must be taken out; the opening re-made about four feet wide and three and one half feet high; the throat made four inches deep and four feet wide; a smoke chamber built about eight feet high with a windshelf eight inches deep; the flue (circular) adjusted to the new opening; a damper put in and the chimney raised six feet.
3rd. The fireplace of the middle room should first have the bricks out away on the sides to give the full width of the opening - about five feet. Possibly a hood to lower the height will be needed.
Surely the smoke chamber, windshelf, etc. must be made according to require-ments sent you. The throat can be widened to the full five feet and a damper inserted and the chimney heightened six feet.HOUSE "C"
Fortunately this house has not advanced so far that the chimneys cannot be easily reconstructed. They must be at once.
Take down fireplaces in bedrooms; widen openings and throat; build smoke chamber amply large and high as per figures in specifications; make windshelf; insert damper; heighten chimney.
Second, big fireplace can be build right and must not be erected until it has all requirements exactly as in article.Mr. Hearst's Specifications for Fireplaces
