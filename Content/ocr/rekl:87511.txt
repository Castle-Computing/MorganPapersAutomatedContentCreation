Dear Miss Morgan:

The fireplace in the East Room, or so-called Breakfast Room, is not any good.  It never 
has been any good and never will be until we make the radical alteration that is 
necessary.

Whenever we build a fire in it, we have to open the door and let in the cold air from the 
outside, and sit in a draught, and get a crick in the back of the neck, and get warm in 
front and cold in back or vice versa; and the fireplace under those conditions is of no 
use.

It is pretty much impossible for it to contribute enough heat to overcome the cold that 
enters from the outside.

We have tried ventilating the fireplace with air passages to the outside.  We have tried 
new chimneys and chimney-tops; but nothing is of any benefit.

The trouble with the fireplace is the flue is too small.

We have built up the base of the fireplace until it is almost two feet above the ground, 
and still the opening is too large for the flue, or rather the flue is too small for the 
opening.

It seems to me there is nothing to be done except the one thing necessary,-- enlarge the 
flue.

When we go away for a sufficient length of time, I wish you would kindly put down on the 
program of construction this change in the flue of the fireplace in the East Room as one 
of the most important things to be done.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
