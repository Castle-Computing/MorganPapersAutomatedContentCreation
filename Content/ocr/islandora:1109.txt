February 3, 1920.

my Deariﬁiss Morgan :

The general appearance of the lobby en-
closed is samething like I would wiéh to have the entranCe I
lobby of my small house. Of course we would have a little
more SpaniSh treatgent, but I mean a ceiling samethﬁg of
this character and generally White walls With the relief of

the darker doors and some sort of ornamental feature at eabh

end, With smﬂe Simple furnishings.

Sincerely,
