Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards electric fixtures,- there seems to be lots of standards in your shipments, but practically no brackets suitable for interior use.

The brackets for the living room House A, either side of the tapestries, should be important.  The only brackets offering difficulties of design are those in the bed rooms of C, on account of the Moorish design they really form part of.

Shall I buy simple, suitable standards for baths of B and C, as these rooms are strictly utilitarian?

There are ample plugs for standards and if more are needed they can readily be brought up from below.

On account of the leader pipes on the corners, it took some time to evolve a suitable bracket for the Spanish lanterns for the exterior corners.  These are being made ny Trinkeller, the Los Angeles man, who made the Los Angeles Examiner grilles and they promise well.  I had one made first and tried it up.

Yours very truly,
