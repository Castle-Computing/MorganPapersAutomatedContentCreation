Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Bistany went more into detail as to advice here yesterday, and introduced the 
young man he mentioned as a possible head keeper.  He is a young giant from Palo Alto 
who has been entirely trained by Mr. Bistany.

Out of the visit I gather that Mr. Bistany would be glad to come to the Hill when you 
are there and after consultation, separate the animals into geographical groups.  He 
says the present Hill method of catching and separating animals is cruel and ruinous.  
In the new grouping, the giraffe barns and pens with some shelter, plus the 
rearrangement of present shelters in other sections with food troughs and sanitary 
floors, would carry the field animals through the winter, plus the hospital if 
possible, but the location of this would depend on the segregations decided upon.

In the meantime, the new clean troughs, big kangaroo, etc. you O. K. on the copy of 
the report you sent me, are being taken care of.

Compared with the condition of the animals at the Fleishhacker Zoo - our Hill ones 
show need of revised methods and care.

I'm wondering if Mary Ann, Mary and Jerry, the cute bears and any other interesting 
acting animals, plus beautiful birds of many kinds, all in a sort of Persian garden 
on Animal Hill, might not give more interest and pleasure than the caged cat family, 
and at a very much less upkeep cost.  If the garden were enclosed completely the pink 
flamingos, parrots, etc. could all be free with their own decorative quarters.

In any case, the Hill looks like destruction embodified - George is moving oaks so as 
to finish the middle section of the grading as housing will Page 2 - Mr. William Randolph Hearst

have to be provided here before the present quarters are vacated.  One oak is 
already on the outer line of the new greensward circle in front of the Roman Pool, 
the new road outlined.  We need you home.

As always,

Yours truly,
