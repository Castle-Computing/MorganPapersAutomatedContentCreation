FOR THEATER SIDE WALLS WITH RICH CARYATIDES OR COLUMNS AT SIDES UNDER MAIN PROSCENIUM 
BEAM USING FOR CEILING PRESENT NATURAL BEAMS PLASTERED USING SOME OF YOUR ANTIQUE CARVED
 CORBELS UNDER BEAMS AT WALLS THIS WOULD ALLOW USE OF CAL ACOUSTIC PLASTER A SOUND 
 DEADENING AND FIREPROOF SURFACE ON ALL WALLS AND ON CEILING PANEL SOFFITS THIS WITH 
 CARPET ETC SHOULD PROVIDE VERY SOUND ABSORBENT SURFACES THROUGHOUT
