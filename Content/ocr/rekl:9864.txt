Dear lilies liorgan :

I think this would be a good.bench to put
below "C" where the wall makes a corresponding curve.

(See large photograph.marked ~l-)

. What I would like to know is how big should the figures
be made to go there preperly?

,I imagine the figures in this photograph are almost
life size if not quite so. Wbuld we want ours any smaller?

2. I am.sending you diagrams of another house. I
do not think this house I am sending is very good and I have, in
accordance with your telegram, ordered the Yorkshire stone Jaco~
bean house, and asked h'.ihcPeake in London to find other windows,
doarframes, etc. for its embellishment.

Sincerely,
