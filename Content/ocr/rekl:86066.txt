Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Williams wrote that you wished another galvanized iron warehouse erected at San 
Simeon at once.

We are getting figures on unit similar to the two now there, but I am wondering if 
we could not so handle present material that it would not be necessary.

For instance, the most bulky materials, stored at present in the warehouses, consist 
of the wood ceilings and stone and marble items.

We know now fairly definitely the rooms in the theater wing where a number of these 
ceilings are to be installed.   Could we not, without opening these cases, store each 
of these ceilings in its future space, - this system to include the ceiling material 
for the Gothic study, bulky and now in the concrete warehouse.  If you see no objection, 
I think this would release enough space in the three better warehouses to take care of 
all the really valuable material.  There is a considerable amount of bulk material of
 no great value that could be weeded out of the galvanized iron warehouses, consisting 
 of plaster moulds, casts, second hand frames, etc. from the Hill, that could be stored
  in the wooden unit.

If this meets your approval, we can undertake to see that Mr. Williams understands 
what to do.

Yours very truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
