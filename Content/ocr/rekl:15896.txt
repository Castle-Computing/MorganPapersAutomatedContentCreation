Dear Miss Morgan:

I am sending you oodles of stuff.

First, there is the mater of the Anaconda brass pipe which I suppose, of course, we will use in the beach house.  But there are other Anaconda products which I think we must use there, because the salt sea air is tremendously damaging to ordinary metals.  I think that exposed hardware should be of copper or brass, and that the knobs indoors should be of glass or porcelain where not of brass.

The glass is good Colonial, and I am sending you a clipping from one of the house furnishing publications which shows a knob with WashingtonÕs bust on it.  I would like to use some patriotic stuff of this character.

2.  I am also interested in getting the proper insulation down there, because it can be very cold, and also very hot, and also very damp.  I think on the whole ArmstrongÕs cork board insulation is the best.

3.  I am anxious to provide as thoroughly as possible against fire.  I understand there is a preparation in the nature of a paint to be put on the interior beams and planking in addition to a more or less fireproof paint for exterior use.  Then again there are asbestos shingles.

As there is no good fire department for this section, I want to depend as much as possible on construction to prevent or control fire.

4.  There is a further point, as to what is the best wiring system.  I am enclosing a clipping on that;  but of course I do not know whether the stuff advertised is materially better than what we can get on the Coast.  In connection with the wiring, there are Connecticut switch devices, which I think are effective and attractive.

5.  I am including a clipping for mahogony doors and one about the Corbin screen door checks.

I suppose we are going to put in the Frigidaire refrigerating system, unless you know something better.  And I think gas ranges are the thing for us there, as I understand there are gas connections.

I am including a clipping about brass weather vanes and gate signs, and a floor polishing machine, and an incinerator plant, and an electric clock connection.

I think the electric clock idea is worth while and should be attended to while we are putting in the wiring.

I do not think we should use metal lath, as it is likely to corrode.  I do not know what will take its place, but of course you will find something.

The casement windows are important, and the Truscon seem to be good.  I do not know whether they are the best.

I imagine we will need double windows and I also want outside solid wood shutters which can be closed in storm time.

In the June issue of House and Garden there is a nice article about gardens by the sea which I think we should keep and refer to.

It shows what can be grown to advantage on the seashore, and there seem to be a lot of things.

I am also sending you a clipping about hook rugs, as we may want to use some in the bedrooms.

Here is a clipping about lanterns, etc.  And that is all, I guess, about the beach house.

In regard to the ranch-- I am enclosing a clipping about water lillies.  You will remember I wrote lately about the desirability of having day  water lillies in one pool and night water lillies in another;  also about the desirability of having a night garden.

I wish you could put someone making investigations to find out how to do this to the best advantage, and then let us think where we can place it.

I suppose we do not use rhododendrons and peonies, but they are mighty pretty.  If we cannot use them, let us b sure to get the most out of the flowers like the lillies, concerning which I wrote you-- the gladiolas, the cannas, and the dahlias

There is a page on the June garden which pleas find enclosed, I guess we would better give it to our gardner.

I think tuberoses would be very nice at the ranch. They are smelly and somehow seem to go with the Spanish plan.

I want to call your attention to the anchor fences with the metal posts.  I do not know how high these come, but I imagine they would be better than the fences we have been using for the animals. If you think so, let us the metal posts hereafter.

I am enclosing a clipping of the Maytag washer, which I would like to try at the ranch;  also a clipping of some cheap little greenhouses.  I think we might use a couple of them.

There is an article on pinks.  Does our gardner seem to be having trouble with them?  Perhaps he will find a solution.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
