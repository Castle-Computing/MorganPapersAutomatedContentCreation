Dear Mr. Joy:-

I don't want any elaborate system of hot houses and lath houses and things of that kind and I do not want anything of the things that go in the hot houses until we build the permanent hot houses which I discussed with Miss Morgan to go in connection with the bathing pavilion.

The planting on this hill I would like to have in a way as personal as the houses themselves and , consequently, I really have not any particular need for Mr. Gardner Daley.  He comes down only occasionally, which is not objectionable, but he is not as familiar, I think, with conditions on the hill as those of us who live here.  Therefore, his suggestions have not had up to date any great value.  On the other hand, I would not want him to take on any actual charge because he would build something according to his ideas and, good as they may be, what we who live here want is simply according to our own ideas.

I want a scheme of planting here which not only avoids hot house stuff but largely avoids the kind of planting and flowers which require great deal of attention.  I want the bulk of the planting to be stuff that will take care of itself, and, as I explained to Miss Morgan, only the borders and occasional features like the rose garden to be the kind of flowers that need gardeners' attention.  I have in a general way in mind what I ant and I will talk with Miss Morgan and ask her to design graceful ways of architecturally arranging the plants and it seems to me that the presence of another person with other and more elaborate plans is not an advantage for the particular kind of thing that we want done.

You may send a copy of this letter to Miss Morgan and I will see her about the matter when I am in San Francisco.

The propagating frames, etc. which are necessary can be erected on the little flat hill where the small green house is just below where the propagating frames we have been using are.  I like all these structures to be made on a small scale and without concrete foundations, just as the little green house used to be so that they can be moved and removed without digging trenches and otherwise disfiguring the landscape.

I am sorry that we have the store house.  It is a great big eye sore and I am going to get rid of it just as soon as possible, but I certainly do not want any other things of the same kind and I would like the men to work building permanent structures and building a lot of temporary stuff which is of considerable expense and very little use and which I personally don't really want.  The permanent stuff which could have been built and should have been built are the garage, warehouse, the machine shop, etc. around the court that we planned down where the horse and cow corral now is.  And then later the horse and cow stables could be placed to the East of that as we discussed.  As fat as my furniture and materials and antiques are concerned that have not already been sent to the ranch, I think they should be retained in warehouses in San Francisco until such time as we actually need them to use them.

Very truly,
