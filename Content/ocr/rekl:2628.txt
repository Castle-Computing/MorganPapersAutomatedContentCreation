Dear Miss Morgan:

I have a kind of an idea and I think it is practicable

Instead of building up another terrace which will never be used would it not be cheaper and even more effective architecture to recut the steps leading down to the terrace making them steeper and to add slips as shown in above diagram and to lower the
floor of the existing terrace so as to give a full view of the loggia back of it.  adding only two (?) to the steps alone would bring us down a couple of feet and if we added additional steps we could get down four feet at least.  That would be equal to removing the parapet and I remember that you said the appearance was at (?) best before the parapet was put on.

The cost of cutting down would not be as great as the cost of building up an entire new terrace would it?  
The effect might be better as the new terrace wold cut off a good deal of the old one in the perspective then we would be relieved of the makeshift of an iron rail and a day (?) low parapet etc.

What do you think
