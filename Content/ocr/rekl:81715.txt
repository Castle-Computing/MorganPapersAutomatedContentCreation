Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst received your letter regarding Divet and said:

"I am agreeable to keeping Divet, although I certainly do not like his attack on his 
son-in-law.  Perhaps it would be just as well to let the son-in-law go somewhere else. 
Divet seems to get along with everybody else."

---------

The San Simeon school board-- PARKS, KEEP, SEBASTIAN-- asked Mr. Hearst about the 
prospect of a new school building, in view of the need of some improvements in present
 building at this time which they hesitated to undertake if a new building was to be 
 provide.

Mr. Hearst said:

"Get the line surveyed for the town down there, and put the new building-- which I 
will give them-- where we would naturally put it in the layout; and consult the school 
board to see if that is a satisfactory location.

---------

So here I am coming to you as the fountain of all information on building operations 
in this part of the world to ask if the town line has been surveyed, or if you can 
advise me in any way on the subject.  Has a layout been made, and if so where have 
you place the school, and shall I take it up with board or will you do so  on your 
next visit?  Thanking you,

Sincerely,

s/ J Willicombe
