Dear Mr. Willicombe:

The plant list enclosed in your letter of December 15th is received and I will see they are attended to.

The boxes of the last carload of columns, etc. have not been opened except on crate, which gave evidence of the contents being broken. It is one of four packed by Elmore and the breakage was due to the method used - the ends of the column havin no support.  I have sent it down to San Simeon as it is needed and will have the best repair possible made.  The break was not a clean one, but fractured off a dozen or more small fragments.

Yours very truly,
