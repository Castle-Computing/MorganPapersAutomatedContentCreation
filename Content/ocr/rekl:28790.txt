Dear Mr. Hearst:

It has been difficult to get good pictures of the sites of the proposed animal shelter houses because nearly always such localities are above or below a road bank.  Each of the tentative sites has an open and fairly level feeding ground adjacent.  Mr. Slattery had Mr. Addison try each one out with a bale of hay and it certainly was a pretty sight coming down to see the way in which the animals grouped themselves - on these natural feeding spots.

The numbers 1 to six run from the upper gate down toward San Simeon. All the shelters would be quite well protected by natural conditions except at #3.

We have located and bargained for the red wood logs for posts and log cabined parts and for bark slabs from large red wood trees for the roofing.

The shelters show various ideas - high roofs, low roofs, etc. as a try out.  Would you want them all of one type?

Yours very truly,

handwritten note:
This want in my best handwriting
