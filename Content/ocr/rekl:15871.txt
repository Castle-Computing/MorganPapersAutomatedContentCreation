Dear Miss Morgan:

Referring to you letter of June 3rd regarding the gardener at the ranch:

Mr. Hearst said, "The gardener has mistake instructions.  I merely told him to plant it with some plan and system.  I am discouraged about the gardener.  I don't think that he will do at all.  I would like to try another man."

Sincerely yours,

s/ J Willicombe

Secretary to Mr. Hearst

[handwritten note]
On Sunday, June 20th at SS. Mr Hearst said the man was doing better and I might work out satisfactorily with Miss Moore to guide -
