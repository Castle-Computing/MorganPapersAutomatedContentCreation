IF I AM NOT ABLE TO GO TO RANCH UNTIL TWENTY SECOND THINK YOU CAN SAFELY GO AHEAD 
AND CONSTRUCT PATH FOR PERGOLA FRUIT TREES THAT ARE REMOVED FROM PATH COULD PROBABLY 
BE REPLANTED IN SUCH WAY AS TO MAKE THEM AVAILABLE FOR PERGOLA THEY HAVE NOT GROWN TO 
SUCH EXTENT THAT THEY CANNOT BE TRAINED TO SPREAD OUT LINE VINES OVER PERGOLA IN FACT 
WOULD THINK THEY WERE JUST ABOUT RIGHT AGE FOR SUCH TRAINING CHIEFLY HOWEVER WE WILL 
WANT FANCY ORANGES AND WILL SEND YOU LIST OF WHAT I THINK WOULD BE DESIRABLE HOWEVER 
THERE IS TIME ENOUGH FOR PLANTING AFTER WE GET PERGOLA AND AM ANXIOUS TO GO AHEAD WITH 
THAT CONSTRUCTION SOON AS CONVENIENT AM GLAD WE ARE GOING HAVE ASSEMBLY ROOM FOR
