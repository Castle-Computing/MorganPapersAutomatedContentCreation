Dear Miss Morgan:

Replying to your letter of October 22nd, Mr. Hearst instructed me to state that he did 
say he would pay this but this is a little inconvenient for him to do so and to ask if 
there is any other way that you can secure it, - postponing something until after 
December 1st, and after we let people off and cut down expenses we can pay those bills
 as we did last year.  Please advise me.

Sincerely yours,

s/ J. Willicombe

Secretary to W. R. Hearst.
