Mr. Hearst.

dear Sir,

1.  The division fence between the upper and lower deer field was constructed of too 
light a grade of wire to hold the larger animals. They continually break thru and get
 injured in fighting.  The upkeep of such a fence is heavy and there will doubtless
  be some animals killed if it is not fixed.  We have all the material for placing a 
  heavier wire thereon; all that is needed is the labor.  Is there not some way 
  whereby I can get this fence fixed in the near future?

[Handwritten: Mr. Parks is taking care of fences OK]

2.  The elephant is getting far too big for her house.  The house is too small and 
not strong enough.  She is acquiring a bad habit of breaking thru.  Could we get a 
stronger and larger house for this animal?

3.  How about the moving of the giraffes to the hill top?  Construction of new bard etc.

Dear Miss Morgan: I think this should be done at once.  2 The Giraffe 
house should also be moved up on the hill.

Sincerely

s/ C.N. Baldwin
