Dear Miss Morgan:

Would it not be well before planting the beds along the road -- on either side -- to widen the road at least as far as the planting would extend, so that there would be ample room for the beds on either side without narrowing the actual roadbed.  I think this would be desirable.

Also while doing this, we could slope the upper banks or terrace them so that they could be used for planting from the roadbed all the way to the top.

sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
