Dear Miss Morgan:

Will you please see how much we can fix up the little house at Pacific Valley so it will be usable and have some of the little pleasing qualities.  It is pretty much of a shack now, but I think it could be reconstructed and extended and made fairly attractive.

Mr. Joy could ride up there with Mr. Parks some day and plan out the improvement.

2.  I want to speak to you about a plan for a shack up at Burnett.  I think it is desirable to have shacks at two or three such points on the ranch so that we can ride a distance and have an overnight headquarters.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
