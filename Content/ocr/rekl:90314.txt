Mr. William Randolph Hearst
111 East 57th Street
New York 

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	Thank you for the letter outlining the 
general building program. 

	I am just back for Wyntoon where they
reported steady rains the last two weeks. As a result, 
the Chalet is entirely finished inside, while the Tea 
House showed little advance. 

	The Chalet's exterior will be finished
by July, but we will not paint until you see it. The 
woodwork is oiled and stain or color can be applied at 
any time. 
	
	No work has been done on the Bridge House
or Angel House so far this year. 

	No damage was done to the frame of the 
Bridge House this winter, although the snow and iee 
packed in solidly between its walls and the bank behind it. 

	At San Simeon, George left the theater
wing abd place generally, neatly cleaned up and protected. 
We had used many of the temporary sash frames above the 
waterproofed covers. 

	The carload of New York ceilings arrived
after work halted, so have had Mr. Williams "warehouse" 
them each in the room space they are to occupy. 

	You will find the new quarters at Jolon
in proper shape next visit -- it certainly needed attention. 
Everytime I go over there, the beauty of the fields and of 
the bordering mountains thrills anew. 

	Hoping you will be at Wyntoon soon, 
	as always, 
	
	Yours truly, 
	
	JM:F
