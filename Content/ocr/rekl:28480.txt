Dear Mr. Hearst:

Week before last we shipped the library furniture from San Francisco by a Bekin's van and took the opportunity to send back a number of large Hacienda rugs and two of your best ones also, for cleaning and moth proofing.  The "moth people" report the need of having some repair of $360.00 for this part of the work.  Shall this be done?

Also sent down some of the chairs from the House B set (bluish green and gold) where old brocade covering had not stood the wear.  Shall these be recovered in the old material (pieced) or would you prefer a stronger new material to match as nearly as possible?

Yours very truly,
