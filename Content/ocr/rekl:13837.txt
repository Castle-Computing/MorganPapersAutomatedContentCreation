Dear Miss Morgan:

Enclosed please find Mr. Hearst's check for $5,000 which he says you are going to send to Byne in Spain to buy things.

Sincerely,

Dear Mr. H
I deported your ck for Mr. Byne and sent him a ck for the same amount with request to push up the most (?) he could find - a fine (?) but (?) such and time etc as opportunity (?)
