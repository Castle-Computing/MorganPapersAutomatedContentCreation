Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards planting --

So far only one carload of trees has been delivered -- eucalyptus mainly.  We finally got some of nearly all kinds you toed, although not able to get them in the exact numbers you indicated.  Also found some other varieties. - They should do well, as all are in tin cans.  This delivery was made just as your telegram came to hold planting -- and are ready to go in.  All other material was ordered held ( not shipped ) until your arrival or orders.

I have talked with the head of the City & Kentia and the exotic Nursery at Santa Barbara, the U.S. Forestry service, Mr. Shere, and Keep, and all think it would be best to get the redwoods out within a month -- on the theory that the longer in the ground before the dry spell next year, the greater the root growth and the more at home the tree.

Mr. Sherer suggests that a few burro would greatly facilitate handling the small trees over the hill sides where trucks and carts cannot go.  Would you care to add two or three to your animal collection?

It will mean continuous work in December and January to get the trees ordered delivered and planted.

The Jacarandas made fine heads this fall.  The Santa Barbara nurseries advise strongly putting up burlap enclosures around each tree, suggesting that if this were done this year, another year's growth would give the trees enough stamina to withstand the cold without further coddling.  This applies to some of the other trees and planting.  Would you take this precaution?
The cypress in the circular basin below C are a failure against animals though carefully handled and protected.  One tree survives.  The bougainvillias, all but tow, "came back" and throve this fall.  The gardener has the annuals for next year planting in the hot beds now and can set out slips and do potting in the bad weather, but in closing camp, if the hillside and orchard planting is to be done, allowance will have to be made for the necessary men.

As regards the fence -- It has gone very slowly - in spite of much prodding.  They were up to garage hill last week, but have the north loop to close yet.  I am ashamed of the slowness.  will report on this again from San Simeon.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
