December 29, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Did you want me to try to locate another housekeeper?  Am sorry we lost the good one reported one.

Am very obedient, working slowly back in, and am looking forward to seeing San Simeon before very long.

With wishes for a very fine and Happy New Year.

Yours very truly,
