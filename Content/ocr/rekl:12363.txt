Dear Miss Morgan:

I cannot see, -- from your drawing, -- any objection tot he bathroom extension on House B.

The scale seems very good -- just as good as the additions to House A.  In fact the alteration puts House B more in line with the scale of House A in MY opinion.

Perhaps some decorative object, an escutcheon or an antique carving on the bare surface of widened sides of B would be good to keep the blank wall with its small windows from being monotonous.  This is easy to make.

With House C, however, the extension is plainly a failure on account of the tower.  There would seem to be nothing to do in C but to divide the bathroom.  I think the small bathrooms with showers will be sufficiently satisfactory.

we will miss the closets but we will have to give these rooms to people who have not many clothes.

The layout for the bedrooms and baths on the top floor of the big house is exceedingly good.  Those rooms should be very attractive for men-- too good for servants, I think.  I shall surely leave here in a week or ten days.  Hope to see you soon.

Sincerely,

s/WR Hearst
