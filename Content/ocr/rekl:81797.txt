December 3, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

These photographs of the marble statues were just received today from Mr. Byne, also 
the note enclosed.

In regards to your telephone message today, I try to have Mr. Byne write directly to 
you so as to save any possible misunderstanding and never have ordered except as you 
have asked me to cable.  He seems to think he had missed connections this summer, but 
I will write again and ask him to send in your regular channels.

I did not go to the Hill Sunday night as they reported a steady storm -- but am taking 
chances tonight for a semi good day to-morrow.

Yours very truly,
