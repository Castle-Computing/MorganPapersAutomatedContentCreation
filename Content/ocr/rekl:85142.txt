DID YOU FIND OUT PRICE OF ANOTHER OCTAVE OF BELLS=

W R HEARST.


Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Miehiels was not at the Ranch Sunday but have a letter form him saying that the 
price of 32 light weight bells of your design and finish would be $4800.00, or 
$150.00 apiece on average.  I had written George Loorz asking him to explain to
 Mr. Miehiels we only want the eight bells and to have him put his price for these 
 in place and connected in writing for you.
