Dear Miss Morgan:

The glass is certainly badly shattered by it can be repaired by using some of the 
original pieces and making some new pieces.

I doubt if this can be done on the Coast.

2.  Fortunately the glass is not what I thought it was, - namely one of the four 
large pieces.  I did not send for the large pieces, but will not return them as we 
may find use for them on the Coast and at present I have no use for them in the East.

3.  Will you please send the broken window back to New York packed with extreme care,
 because glass that has been broken in this way is likely to be further broken in the 
 vibration of shipment.  The small pieces of glass can be collected and sent separately.

The window could wait until we have a carload going East but if you have sufficient 
confidence in the express company we could send it that way.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

P.S.  Will you notify McGregor when shipping, or let me know so that I can tell him 
the window is to be repaired. - Willicombe.
