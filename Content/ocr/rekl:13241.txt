Dear Miss Morgan:

In regard to the rear elevation of the main building as per your drawing No. 503--
I like the wings with the little railing around them similar to the railing on the Venetian balcony.

I also like the main design where the lines of the upper story come down to the ground.  I do not like the less finished alternate so much.  In the alternate the lower part of the building seems to be supporting the upper part on the terrace.

In the main drawing this upper part of the building seems to be supporting itself, as it were, on piers.  It think that latter way is better and not only gives  a more pleasing appearance but an appearance of greater strength and solidity.

I do not know that there is any other point that you wish to call my attention to -- therefore I am not returning the design.  I amy receive a letter from you in relation to it.

There is one other point which may be mentioned.  It is this --

On  each side of the upper part of the main building is a sort of terminal scroll, the right-hand or northern one modeled with a mermaid, the left-hand or southern one comparatively plain.  I am disposed to thing that the left hand or plainer one is the better.  We do not want to get too much ornamentation on the building, and the upper railing is quite elaborate.

However, do as you think best about this matter; I have no very decided preference.

I do not know any other differences or matters that require comment.  I think this building is going to be very fine.  And this rear court is not going to be the least impressive feature.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
