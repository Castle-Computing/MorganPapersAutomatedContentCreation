Dear Miss Morgan:

I wanted to leave some work about the planting, although I do not know that nay of it can be done during the summer months.

I would like to have the orange orchard continues from the wall in front of B until it joins the peach orchard or the vineyard around the bend of the orad to the west.

I thing the orange orchard should be protected, first by planting some oaks down the ridge to the east of the oranges already in and below the oaks which now protect the oranges in front of A.  This ridge running down to the south would protect the oranges from the heavy winter winds.

We can probably get young live oak trees that will stand transplantation, and thus save several years in growing.

2.  I would like some fig trees planted inside the walls or at any rate very near the houses so they would be easily reached.  And I would like  some grape vines run over the pergolas.  They could be mixed up with some evergreen flowering vines so that they would not look bad even in winter and they would be delightfully useful if they provided good grapes in the autumn at easy reaching distance from the houses.

I think the Corishon grapes are good for this purpose, both black and white.  They are a little late, and perhaps an early variety could be run in with them.

I had not intended the vines to go where they are, but perhaps where they are is the best place for them after all.  The chief difficulty is that they are hard to reach.  If they were in the hill above the road instead of on the hillside below the road, they would be much easier to reach.

Facility of approach is after all quite important.

The hill where the Chinese house is to be put should have some planting on it.  My idea is to put stuff on it that does not have to be cared for -- drought resisting shrubs.  There are a number of them, white and yellow and other colors, which would make a beautiful hillside.  Some flowering trees could be planted there later, but not I think until after the house is built.

I think the conifers should be planted on the hill that sustains the reservoir.  This hill is barren and not pretty.  It would be fine, however, if covered with groves of fir and spruce and deoders and other attractive evergreens of this variety.  They could be watered from the reservoirs while they are young.  Deep holes should be blasted and filled with pretty good soil, because, if you remember, the analysis of the water that comes from that hill shows there is rock and mineral there not good for vegetation.

This mineral cannot be deadly, however, for lower down on the hill the oaks and other trees are quite abundant.  The thing is to cover the upper reaches that are now bare with a fine growth of conifers and we will have a beautiful hill there. 

While not much planting can be done now, a great deal of ordering should be done so we will have the necessary conifers and fruit trees and other trees and plants and shrubs when the time for planting comes.

You will remember there is a trough about half-way between the hilltop and the farmhouse below.  It seems to me that somewhere in that neighborhood we should plant a whole lot of flowering trees--up the steep hillside to the north and in other places around about.

Trees there would not interfere with the view and would make a lovely spot, or several lovely spots, at this half-way house between the ranch-house and the hilltop.

The flowering eucalyptus, the accadia, the jacaranda, and the magnolia are the best trees I can think of.  Some cork oaks would be interesting gin certain places.  Then there are some other plants and trees that I have made notes of in the Niles catalogue.  I will send the catalogue along marked later.  I am just hurrying off these general outline as to the planting, so that we can make adequate preparations.

Sincerely
