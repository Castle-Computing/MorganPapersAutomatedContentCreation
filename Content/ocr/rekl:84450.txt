Dear Mr. Hearst:

I spent Tuesday on the Hill, assuring everyone they could do what was laid out. This is just to say that you may, on first impression Sunday not think so, but we have Mr. Hadley, the pavements and stone man back, have enough material there or on way to do the terraces and steps as soon as Mr. Rossi releases the spaces, and have the balustrade toward the sea on the pool terrace sufficiently done to be sure this too can be in place by the July holidays -- so please don't be discouraged, and oblige

Yours very truly,
