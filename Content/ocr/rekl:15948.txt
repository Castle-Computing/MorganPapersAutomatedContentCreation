Dear Miss Morgan:

1. The two more 4-bed unit helps' houses will undoubtedly be sufficient and satisfactory.

2.  We should probably have a refrigerating machine for making ice and in addition Frigidaire refrigerators run independently to take care of the various meats, etc.

3.  I think it would be a good idea to have a man take care of the refrigerating plant, but of course not do only that.  There are doubtless many other things that he could do and a certain division of labor and fixing of responsibility among the various men that work on the property would be desirable. 

4. If you don't find the Frigidaire sufficiently reliable and you find something else better, will you kindly let me know.  I will not insist on Frigidaires, but I have had very good experience with them.

5.  The housekeeper you mention seems to have a very good record and the fact that she wants a country resort is advantageous.  There is enough country around our resort to satisfy anybody.

6.  I had not noticed the antique bureau and table covers.  I will communicate immediately with Tomkins and with Ann in regard to this.  Of course a housekeeper would have an eye on such matters.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
