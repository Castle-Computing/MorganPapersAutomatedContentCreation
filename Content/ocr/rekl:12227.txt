Dear Miss Morgan:
Here are some pictures that I believe belong to Mt. Byne
which you sent Mr. Hearst some time ago; therefore I am returning same.
2.— Mr. Hearst says that if you like the horn lantern that he
sent you as a sample some time ago, will you please order enough of
them to be able to use them in the winter on the corners of the houses.
He does not think they will break the way the glass lanterns do no
matter how the wind witches them about. Enclosed is picture of a
similar one, but from a different source.
3. Mr. Hearst told me to send you the enclosed photographs
and drawing of this temple.

"I have bought this and I thought it might be well to erect
it in the rose garden against the trees Where we were putting>the
pergola”, said Mr. Hearst.

"It would look beautiful against the trees facing the
houses, and we might use a pergula on each side."

Mr. Hearst said he hoped the rose garden was planted and
told me to ask you if there was anything you wanted him to do before
he went West and he will attend to it if you will telegraph him,as he will
be leaving shortly.

Sincerely yours,

JW/LD.
