Dear Miss Morgan:
Here are some pictures that I believe belong to Mt. Byne
which you sent Mr. Hearst some time ago; therefore I am returning same.
2.— Mr. Hearst says that if you like the horn lantern that he
sent you as a sample some time ago, will you please order enough of
them to be able to use them in the winter on the corners of the houses.
He does not think.they will break the way the glass lanterns d9.ne
matter hOW'the wind witches them about. Enclosed is picture of a?
ehmilar one, but from a different source.
3. Hr. Hearst told.me to send you the enclosed photographs
and drawin c this temple. ,

ﬂ bought this and A 1:110th '5: might be well to erect
it in the rose garden against the trees Where we were putting>the
pergola”, said.ﬂr. Hearst.

"It would look beautiful against the trees facing the
houses, and.um might use a pergula.on each side."

Mr. Hearst said.he hoped the rose garden was planted and '
told me to a3k.you if there was anything you wanted.him to do before
he went Westﬂhe  attend to it if you will telegraph him,as he will
be leaving shortly.

Sincerely yours,
