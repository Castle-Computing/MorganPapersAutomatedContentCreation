Dear Mr. Hearst:

Today I received the enclosed answer from Mr. Byne to last week's cable.  In the 
meantime I had written him that you wanted a drawing showing the general effect and 
composition of the big Sahagun ceiling, of which he says he sent a sketch.  We did 
not receive it.

Yours very truly,
