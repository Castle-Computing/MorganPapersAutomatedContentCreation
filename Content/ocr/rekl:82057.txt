Dear Miss Morgan:

We have been proceeding vigorously with the north wing-- maybe a little too 
vigorously-- but I do not think any harm has been done.

We are now ready to go ahead with the terrace.

I have asked Mr. Rossi to get his full quota of men.  Will to finish up the in-door 
pool promptly as possible, and there will be nothing new undertaken until these things 
are finished.

I have talked to Mr. Joy about the masts and awnings and lights for the tennis courts, 
and he is planning these.

This has been taken up at this time because it is naturally necessary to have the 
foundations for these masts properly made, and if there is any construction to be 
done in this connection it would better be done now than after the pool and dressing 
rooms, etc., are finished.

Mr. Joy will explain to you that placing the masts where I would greatly like to have 
them will involve some rearrangement of the decorative features as well as possibly 
strengthening f foundations.

I think, however, the masts should surely be in line with the rail and the decorative 
part of it and should not intrude at all on the unwise court space, especially as the 
foundations are more easily found in this arrangement.

the re-designing of the decorative features I think will be very simple.  But in order 
to make it simpler, I suggest that we omit the caryatids altogether and simply use piers
 or pilasters.

I have talked this over with Mr. Joy.  The will be cheaper and equally good looking, 
and will harmonize more easily with the mast arrangement.

The plan of the masts is to use twelve,-- four at the north end, four at the south end, 
and four across the middle of the court,-- that is to say, between the two courts, 
for the courts under this arrangement would run East and West.

The direction of the sun does not matter much when we have ample awnings, and I would 
suggest awning both onto and at the sides, to be spread out or drawn in as desired.

This East and West alignment of the courts is much better for the spectators; because,
 when sitting on the esplanade terrace or on the terrace above the esplanade, they will 
 not be bombarded with the balls, and they will get a better view of the game.

The Awnings will shut off the sun in almost any direction.  The awning masts will also 
be lighting masts.

The awnings I think best to have about thirty feet high; the lights to be from three to
 five feet above this again.

This seems to work out pretty well.

When I go down this next Sunday to Los Angeles, I probably will not return for a month, 
so work can proceed on the courts for that period at least without interruption.


As the size of our parties here is increasing I would greatly like to have the Celestial
 Suite finished as soon as possible.  That would give us two more rooms.

We could also accommodate an additional two me people as soon as we have the twin beds 
in each of the Doge's Suite bedrooms.

I hope these matters are proceeding.



I have cut down the chicken house area by half.  I think we had it on too large a scale.

We should have a field to raise alfalfa in and we should have a field for breeding 
houses and other shacks in connection with chicken raising.

The new plan can be made more effective architecturally, because it is smaller and 
more compact; furthermore, it will cost a great deal less money, and will give us all 
the space we need.

Finally, it will allow us to proceed promptly with the grading and draining and 
graveling, and the completion of the dwelling, so that we can actually take care of
 our chickens.

It will be much better to have a smaller place, and to have it finished before Winter 
sets in, than it would be to have too ambitious a proposition and have to take another
 year to get it into shape.

I am trying to get our operations as a whole limited in extent, so that we can bring 
some of them to completion.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
