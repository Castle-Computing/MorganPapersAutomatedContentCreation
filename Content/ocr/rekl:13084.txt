Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst;

On November 2, 1921 we issued a certificate in favor of Mr.Payne covering a payment of $1068.45 due on the plumbing contract on the houses.  Mr. Bogart's office says the amount due was paid by check No. 1758 on the Chase National Bank, in the sum of $1068.45.  Mr. Payne claims never to have received this check and has repeatedly asked that either the canceled check be produced or a new check be issued to him.

There is no question as to the amount of the bill or the correctness of the certificate.

Yours very truly,

JM 
GRC
