September 4, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

At Mr. Clark's request I am sending you a copy of the Board of Fire Underwriters' report you asked us to have made last year.

We have followed their layout as far as we have gone, but we have not put any hose reels in the buildings and have not laid the line around the esplanade -- but have it planned.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
