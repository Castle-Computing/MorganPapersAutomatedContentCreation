Dear Mr. Hearst:

In regards to the pool data to have been sent Miss Head, I am at fault in not having 
explained to you that after writing you, I found on looking up the material to 
forward, that we had already sent complete pool construction and circulating data 
with pool lining samples and cut of gutter to Miss Head for Sir Charles Allom on 
September 6th, 1929, as explained in the enclosed letter to Miss Head.

The only item lacking was a sample of the big terra cotta hand-rail gutter, which was 
not obtainable.

We have sent Miss Head this afternoon by express a large section of the terra cotta 
hand-rail, samples of the green tile lining, details of gutters, overflow hand-rail, 
etc. - plans of typical outdoor pools and of their circulating, piping, and other 
details; otherwise have duplicated practically the original list.

If Miss Head would send us the plan of the St. Donat pool with the relation to the 
heater and filter room, we would willingly show on it a full piping, heating, 
circulating and filtering system according to our practice.  We have twenty-two
pools in operation just now, and by keeping in touch with them, have come to some 
quite definite conclusions.

Very truly yours,

Enc.
