Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Last week there was mailed you studies for the rear elevation of the main building and also a carefully studied esplanade layout -- taking into consideration the trees, grades, etcetera in detail.

I have been working several weeks on the rear elevations -- study after study -- trying to get something fine from it.  It suddenly occurred, that the railing on this side and on the tea terrace side need not be alike and that possibly an emphasizing of the Venetian motifs by copying the balustrade of the loggia might offer a very decorative solution.  You will remember that the new wings do not center on the old rear, but offset on account of the trees.  If anything happened to the trees this might make the tile roof of the first studies look misplaced, while a flat top would not draw so much attention to the change of axis.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
