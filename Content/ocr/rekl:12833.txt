Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Bldg., 
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Miss Morgan:-

We enclose herewith a small circular which briefly explains our services in the care of trees.  We understand that you are architect for the William Randolph Hearst property in San Luis Obispo County and feel that as such you are interested in this sort of work and believe that you will be particularly interested to learn of the methods of tree surgery employed by our firm.

We have been established in California since 1911 and during that period have rendered services to a large number of clients who have changed over from the solid concrete type of filling to our methods.

we have done considerable work for Myron Hunt, architect, and other prominent architects in the south and shall be pleased to communicate with you further if you so desire.

Very sincerely yours,
s/Freeman, Myers and Co.
