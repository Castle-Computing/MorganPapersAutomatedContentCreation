Dear Mr. Hearst:

While at supper Saturday at the tip end of the Refectory table, I felt seasick and looking up saw the silver lamps in the Patio Hall slowly swinging over a considerable arc.  There was no jolt, but the quake on the previous morning everyone said was a really sharp and long tremor.  The only damage noticeable was the cracking across of the unfinished semicircular basin below the Main Building, (balancing that below House B) and the opening of some old joints.

I went down the road form the Hill top to the lowest gate with Mr. Rossi and Mr. Slattery, (Mr. Addison being called to Los Angeles by Mr. Hunter), locating places for the new shelters, both to have photographs made and for being sure that at each point the practical need could be met.  It was cloudy and foggy, so pictures that afternoon were not possible.  Will send with the sketches as soon as they can be had.  There were many varities of animals in evidence -- the little speckled antelope are very sweet.

There is a large gang on the roads -- and the work looks trimmer and more workmanlike than under the last foreman.  The 'rocking' is proceeding rapidly and we are sending up the last of the needed culverts.  I have asked Mr. Rossi as soon as the banks are ready for Mr. Keep's next planting to grade down, level, etc. the 'Grande Place' in front of the Tennis Court Building and the roads in this connection, as if it is not done soon the turn will be impassible this winter. If you seen any objection to this program, will you let me know?  Another reason for doing it is that the whole area in this region has become construction field from the warehouse to the Main Building, and it will force the clearing up of this part of the grounds.  Some concrete has been poured on the service wing and the attic of the Tennis Court Building is almost ready to pour.  House  C terrace is completely poured.  It is fine.

It is quite an area, your ranch, even from San Simeon to the Hill, for a brand new man to take in, given all the humans and animals to become acquainted with.  I found Mr. Slattery doing very well, - but quite full of questions.

The stone men were let go as you suggested, but the stone could not be stopped and am glad anyway that it will be available when needed.

I waited sending this, thinking Mr. Rossi's letter you mentioned in your telegram might reach me today, but it did not.  I am sorry he gave a wrong impression, as you would be content I am sure if you could see the every day conduct of your household there.  It is actively busy and has a happy air.

Yours very truly,
