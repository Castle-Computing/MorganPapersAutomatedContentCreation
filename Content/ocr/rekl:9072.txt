WILL IT BE POSSIBLE STOP ALL OUTSIDE CONSTRUCTION ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST AND LAY OFF ALL MEN EXCEPT INSIDE DECORATORS PLASTERERS AND MEN WORKING ON ORCHARDS AND OTHER NECESSARY MATTERS THINK ALSO DESIRABLE KEEP MEN LIKE HADLEY AND ASSISTANT WHO ARE EXCEPTIONALLY GOOD AND COULD NOT BE REPLACED THIS IS IN LINE WITH YOUR PROPOSITION OF WHILE AGO AND MY PERSONAL OPINION IS THAT NEW DEAL AND LITTLE MORE SUPERVISION WOULD RESULT IN GREATER EFFICIENCY AND ECONOMY
