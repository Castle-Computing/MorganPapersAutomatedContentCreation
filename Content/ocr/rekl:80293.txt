July 3, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As to a new woman chef -- How would this one's qualifications appeal, -- given one cannot sample productions ahead of engagement?

A fairly buxom middle aged blond South of France widow, good humored, gesticular, who learned her profession in Lyons, and came to this country with her husband, an expert decorative marble cutter.  After his death she worked as chef for one of the best catering firms in St. Louis, was loaned by them to the (Chicago) Lake Front Club, has a number of very fine letters -- She came out here because some relatives are in San Francisco - and cooked for the Highland Hospital.  They, and all her recommendations, state that she is a fine cook and emphasize her amiability and sobriety.  All expressed regret at her decision to depart.  She is in no hurry to take a position, although free to come when wanted. - I was well impressed with her personality.

Yours very truly,
