Am very much afraid that unless we go ahead full speed we

are not going to get our program through in time. July is
almost over and very little has been done. I will tell Mr.
Rossi to get more men as soon as we get the data to proceed
with. We are ready now to go ahead with the terrace ,the
indoor pool and the amusement wing as soon as we get drawings.
We must also have plans for draining the indoor pool and for
heating the water. Everything should be complete if the pool
is to be useable. Similarly with the theatre the walls should
be up as soon as possible so that the wiring and seating and
heating etcetera can be finished and the theatre be useable.
We are not going to come anywhere near doing this at the
present rate of speed. Finally it has been definitely decided
to use the damask in the living room and to use the valence.
Could you send a decorator down to do this and to finish the
doors and make the room look completed.

Sincerely,

WR Hearst
