Dear Mr. Hearst:

Samples of the "logs" illustrated in the enclosed booklet were mailed San Simeon 
by parcels post today.  They will cut to any lengths, but do not now assemble them,- 
i.e., you simply buy the lumber and build to suit yourself.  The cost is 90 cents a
 square foot - San Luis Obispo.

Yours very truly,
