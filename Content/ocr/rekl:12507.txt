[handwritten note]
Mr. Rossi-please read and return -JM 12-4-22

November 29th, 1922.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I read your letter of November wind.  I am not paying much attention to such stories. The reason for suspending during grainiest months is merely the maximum of expense and minimum of achievement during those months.

Building is enormously expensive at San Simeon at any time.  It is double expensive when the rain makes the roads bad, the boat irregular, the bunk houses uncomfortable and insecure, etc., work is only possible part of the time and the expenses go on all the time.  I advise pouring as long as the good weather lasts and trying to finish the first floor walls.

2.  Regarding the diagram you sent me showing the action of out opening casements.  Out opening casements are successfully made abroad.  I have seen many of them and lived in rooms where such casements resisted storms.  We do not make enough of them over here to know about the various points of protection.

3.  I read the copy of Mr. Rossi's letter which you kindly sent me.  I would like to keep Mr. Rossi.

Sincerely,
s/WRHearst
