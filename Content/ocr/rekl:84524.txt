Dear Mr. Hearst:

The last of the Gothic roof trusses will be placed this week.  It will take two weeks 
to get the concrete roof slab and clerestory (windowed) walls poured.

The ceilings are replaced in the double room made of the twins' rooms and one new 
"deck" room also is ready.  The new Gothic dressing rooms and baths will be in shape 
by the end of the month.  The Celestial Suite rooms will be usable also, but the 
hangings ordered shortly after you left met with a mishap in the weaving and new 
material will not be here until sometime in October.

The new stairs to the Towers are relatively quite spacious.

Although first impressions will be that nothing has been done in your vacationing, 
really many problems are no longer such.  You may not like the furnishing, but I will 
gladly shift it.  We have used a good many of the lovely new things, probably too 
good to stay permanently where now placed.

As always,

Yours very truly,
