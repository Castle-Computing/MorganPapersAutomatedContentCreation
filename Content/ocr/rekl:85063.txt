Mount Vernon, Virginia

Dear Mr. Dodge:

We are having difficulty in identifying the mate to the jar you already have at 
Mount Vernon.  There are two here, and one in New York, of the height and diameter 
you describe.

Will you please lay the cover on a piece of paper and trace off the outline of the 
cover's rim.  Will you also describe the design covering the surfaces of the vase 
proper and of cover, and also describe the knob on the top of the cover.  For 
example, has the jar blue flowers on a white ground - or white flowers on a blue 
ground, or a white or blue ground with vari-colored flowers or leaves?  Also does 
the cover appear to be older than the jar proper?

All the above could be covered by a real photograph with a full description on the back.

Yours very truly,
