Dear ‘ ﬁr. Hearst:

The abutting down of the camp bringe. ea
'ueuel. an evalaeohe 01 bills. same of them years old
~~ accounte like the Heptune Pool Ceeeedo marble, main
Building atelr.merh1e. «e some brena new. as the Roman
Pool ladders, delivered, plumbing, hanginge of Celestial,
curtains at Gothic. steel of Gothic "uplift," marble at
new. baths. 800. . ' . .

It you eould keep up the allowance of
$20,000.00 per month and pay the last $6000.00 on-
the_werehouee. we could take care of the overhead.
camp commiesery for your.permanent men for-the winter.
and keep up the agreed installments on the eaeumuleted
accounts. I think if we make the small payments prompt“
1y ena hold to our agreements with those firms. we can
handle without paying up at one time the old marble
bille and other large standing QGGGuntGa

I hate to lather you, but if this la not a
satisfactory arrangement; it would be neeeeeary to keen
ahead in order to handle to the beat advantage.

As always,

Youre very truly.
