Dear Mr. Hearst:

The shutting down of the camp brings, as
usual, an avalanche of bills, some of them years old
-- accounts like the Neptune Pool Cascade marble, Main
Building stair marble, -- some brand new, as the Roman
Pool ladders, delivered, plumbing, hangings of Celestial,
curtains at Gothic, steel of Gothic "uplift," marble of
new baths, etc.

It you would keep up the allowance of
$20,000.00 per month and pay the last $5000.00 on-
the warehouse. we could take care of the overhead,
camp commissary for your permanent men for the winter,
and keep up the agreed installments on the accumulated
accounts. I think if we make the small payments prompt-
ly and hold to our agreements with those firms, we can
handle without paying up at one time the old marble
bills and other large standing accounts.

I hate to bother you, but if this is not a
satisfactory arrangement, it would be necessary to know
ahead in order to handle to the best advantage.

As always,

Yours very truly,

JM:M
