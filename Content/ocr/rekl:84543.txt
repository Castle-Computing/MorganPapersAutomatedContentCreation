October 21st, 1931

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed are three prints of the end of the new Gothic Study, showing space available 
for the tracery window.

It has taken more time than I thought on Sunday to get the complete Neptune Pool 
drawings made, but they are ready for the printer tonight and will be mailed tomorrow. 
The statuary we hope will be improved upon in real life.

As always,

Yours very truly,
