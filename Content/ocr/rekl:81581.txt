August 7, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

On the Hill yesterday there was a magnificent mass of blooms - and lilies! - thousands of them coming up through the variegated blues of the bedding. It certainly was a sight to remember!

Hadley has made fine progress with the terraces and walks -- is now putting in the esplanade paving back to the Patio entrance on one side and the tennis court line the other.  The south terrace and Sechet pavements are in but waiting the arrival of the colored rile inserts.  It gives a decidedly finished effect.

The shovel has made good headway on the large indoor pool, and all drawings are in Mr. Rossi's hands for the concrete work.  I have been working out a disposition of the balance of the Tennis Court space as per your cable and enclose an outline.  As this cannot be touched until the guests go, it will give you time to suggest any change.  It will be necessary to remove the tennis court slab over the area to be excavated -- as naturally it was not constructed as a roof slab would be.

The animal arena is nearly completed, and the giraffe house starts this week.  The road to Burnett is being steadily worked on also new fencing, - high posts and the high wire for the enclosure having arrived.

It will be two weeks at least before the revised recreation wing drawings are ready, but Mr. Rossi has his hands more than full on the work above, terraces, etc.

I regretted more than I can say upsetting things so on your last Sunday, and the loss of the time with you.  It was a true sun stroke -- nothing organic -- hereafter I shall wear large flopping thick headgear, and promise in any case never to repeat it.

I hope your trip is proving a very very happy one.

Yours very truly,
