Dear Miss Morgan:

I realize the necessity of improving the animal service.  I do not want to divide the 
animals into groups, because I want the roads to go through all this variety of 
animals, and it would be inconvenient to have a number of parallel divisions, all 
separated by fences and gates, with the necessity of continually opening gates all 
the way up the hill.

Moreover, too many divisions, in addition to making an ugly effect, would deprive 
the situation of its naturalness and make you feel that you were driving through an 
artificial zoo, instead of through open fields in which these various animals were 
dissporting themselves.

Mr. Bistany's whole idea is contrary to what I want to accomplish, and rather than 
adopt his idea I would abandon the whole animals proposition.  What he will have to 
do is to find what animals can accommodate themselves to my idea and those that cannot 
do so we will get rid of, except such as we wish to retain on the hill.

2. With regard to the hill, I think we could perfectly well get rid of all the meat 
eating animals and I think we could arrange the other animals, the bears, the 
elephants, giraffes and some interesting samples from our general collection, such 
as a pair of oryxes and a pair of sable antelope, a pair of riding camels, etc., in 
an interesting zoological park, which would also include your pink flamingos, etc.  
We can have a reasonable representation of amusing monkeys and I think it would be 
well to lay out the hill as a park, such as you suggest, rather than as a stiff and 
ugly zoo.

I think we need a man who knows about animals and Mr. Carey Baldwin really does not 
know, and his ignorance is very costly.  The loss of our four beautiful giraffes was 
a calamity.

But I do not intend to replace anything now until I have the quarters ready to put 
them in.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
