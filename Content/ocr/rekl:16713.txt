Dear Mr. Hearst:

In answer to your letter of yesterday.

1.	I think curtains like at the end of the Refectory would solve the draft difficulties.  Would prefer to use only the curtain, or only the grille, as otherwise the curtain would be very close to the grille and possibly would look crowded.

2.	I had to smile on reading your item No. 3 as my mind had traveled the same path.  Yes, I think the big doors would give a feeling of thickness of wall and of protection that would suggest warmth.

3.	As regards the big house, do not you think the sash, etc. about right, given it is agreed the big sash of the Assembly room are to be fixed in place.

4.	Where in House A - B & C there had been no trouble with the sash on the non-exposed sides, do you want the sash replaced with heavier?  I enjoyed your description of "A Night in House A", - but am nevertheless very sorry.

5.	Will make the studies for raising the Patio wings as you suggest in the telegram and this letter.

6	From the program it looks as though we need not worry as to garage hill being pretty fully occupied.  Will also make you the preliminary studies for this hill.

&.	N.B. You always said you would like to see one of those famous storms on the Hill.

Yours very truly,
