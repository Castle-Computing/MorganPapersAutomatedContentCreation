My dear Miss Morgan:

I am sending you check for $15,000, in answer to the pitiful appeal in your letter of June 23rd.  I am unwilling to have you go into hiding from creditors.

Will this check avert the disaster temporarily?  Let me know when another is required.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
