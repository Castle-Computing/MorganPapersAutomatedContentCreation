Dear Miss Morgan:

Of course anything that will keep the wind and weather out of the celestial suite will 
be welcome for the present; but I feel reasonably sure that we will have to radically 
reconstruct in order to get a perfect arrangement.

I think we want to have the same objective there that we have had elsewhere; namely, 
to have very effective double windows in winter and to have a glass window and a screen 
window in summer.

In fact these requirements are more necessary in those high towers than anywhere else, 
because the towers are exposed to such violent winds and to the full force of the 
storms in winter; and in summer all kinds of insects flutter around the lights, and 
invade the tower rooms.

Therefore, we have the same problem as elsewhere, but in an exaggerated degree.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco, Calif.
