Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As to moths:

All the hangings, etc. unpacked from original shipments, whether at San Simeon or the Stringer Warehouse, have been very carefully taken care of in this regard.  I have been through the chests, etc.  recently and they are in fine condition.

Last spring I found that certain chairs in House B were badly infested by moths.  The coverings are much eaten and the old stuffing evidently the source of trouble.  I had Richard thoroughly clean the chairs so far as it could be done without taking the material of -- and have noticed that they are not getting any worse.

We will take the precaution of going through the crates containing upholstered pieces, etc. in the Stringer Warehouse.  It is a clean place, but the risk is self-contained in the old backing and stuffing.

The House B living room chairs are covered with the Spanish brocade you sent some-time ago.  They are ready to send up at any time, but as it will be necessary to send up an upholsterer to place them, I was waiting to send him until Mrs. Hearst's chairs are done so as to make but the one trip for this man.

A most welcome rain has come which could not be better timed for the planting.

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan
