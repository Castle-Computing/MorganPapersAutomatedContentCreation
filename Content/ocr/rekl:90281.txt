Dear Miss Morgan:

	I have suddenly been called to New York. 
I am leaving Tuesday in all probability, and may not be back 
until the first of July. 

	That will put us in Wyntoon at the usual time, and as I 
will have a month away from California, I can stay a month 
longer.

	I am writing this note to suggest that you have the men 
do an extra lot of work at Wyntoon while I am away, -- that is, 
during the month of June. 
		
	You might get some extra men for that period, and then 
when we get out in July, they may relax a bit and maybe save 
the money they spent in June. 

	The result will be, however, that we will have advanced 
further, and that perhaps the bridge house will be near enough 
completion for occupancy. 
	
	Everything else will be further along, -- the projection room
&c., and we will have a better place to go to.

	So I am not unhappy that I have to go to New York during 
June. It will give you a change to make real progress at Wyntoon. 

	2. At the ranch, would you kindly give order to have the 
Crouching Venus transferred to a position in front of the window 
in the court of House B. 

	I think the scale of that figure is about the same as the 
scale of the figures in front of House B at present, and I think 
it will look very well in that location. I do not think it looks 
so well where it is. It is not part of any scheme. 

	I suppose it was put where it is temporarily, but we can 
fix a place for it permanently where I suggest. 

	Sincerely, 
	WR Hearst
