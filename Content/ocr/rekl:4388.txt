Dear Mr. Hearst:

With this is a general planting plan from A to B, with separate plats of the courts and alternate planting lists. The prices are all from this locality - perhaps they could be had for less in south.  I have not separated from these those already covered on the Santa Barbara list.

The color schemes are - 
	For A - pink and white, as the brightest in effect with the dark blue and white frieze tile.
	For C,   crimson and deep yellow.
	For B.   blue, light yellow and orange.

For A - If you do not wish (6) the bedding plant, to be ivy, strawberry could be used, but I imagine the richer, darker green would throw out the pinks more effectively and would need practically no water or care once established. If the lists are too expensive, we could use geraniums, ferns and roses, with either choisya or evonymus for the dark greens and cypress for No. 11.

For C - Under the large oak is a fine place for rhododendronsand we can try the bougainvillias on the sunny side.  The bedding plant No. 9 has a deep yellow flower.  If too elaborate a list, how would just the yellow and red roses , cineraries and ferns do in the court beds, with acanthus for greens, with your rhododendrons under the oaks, evonymus and mahonia up the sides of the path - or else the whole thing in veronica imperialis - (about the color of red of the frieze or a bit more of a magenta).

House A I would love to see with little orange  orange tress in full fruit, yellow and white roses and cerulean blue cinerarieas and woodwardia ferns - but do not know how practical it would be. The list provides a blue flowering carpet for the bank, yews and junipers for the formal "points" with fillers of yellow and blue flowering 
shrubs.

If you would prefer, we could use envonymus and choisya (dark green foliage) entirely at 15, 14, 10 and 9, with cypress at 19, yellow broom with these for color, lobelia for bedding carpet and marigolds, zinnia and cinerarias for 18, 16, 6, etc.

I could suggest very gorgeous seasonal color schemes, but understand you want planting that will not be a continual care.

The gardener has started preparing beds, but it is too wet to haul in soil yet.  A few good days will do wonders.

If the general idea is satisfactory, we could improve on the lists in actual ordering, but want to get this off to you today.

Yours very truly,
