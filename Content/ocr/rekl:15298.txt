Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Byne writes he can and will get the roof tile.  I am very glad.  We did a hose some years ago for one of Mr. H.E. Huntington√ïs daughter, Mrs. Perkins, above Saratoga, and left off the tile until she found old ones in Rome last fall.  They have come and are lovely and soft making a roof incomparable more beautiful then anything I have seen in this country.

As always

Yours very truly,
