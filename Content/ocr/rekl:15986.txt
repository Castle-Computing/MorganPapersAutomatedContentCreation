Dear Mr. Hearst:

In regard to the enclosed letter you received from Mrs. de Mille, thanking you for the gift of china and glass:

This refers to a quantity of glass ice cream cups and plates and glasses (such as used in "ice cream parlors"), and of inexpensive Japanese china, all of which your mother bought when she held the Y.W.C.A. encampment, years ago at the Hacienda.  She was going to give the china to the permanent Y.W.C.A. encampment at Asilomar, but the bottoms were very rough and cut her linen, so she would not give it away.  At the Studio Club, it can be used for the girls' parties only, and the rough bottoms will not matter.

I listed this much of the "gift" in the letter asking your approval of other presents, and you made the marginal note "and more", so I added to this lot one large and pretty modern Canton bowl for "punch" and a collection of several odd lots of modern Canton plates, the whole going well together, and making quite a complete "party" set-up, with the ice cream things.  Mrs. de Mille and her Committee could not have been more pleased.

In money value, the bowl was the only extravagance - I inquired, before sending it, in Chinatown here, and found it could be duplicated for around $20.00

Yours very truly,

Julia Morgan
