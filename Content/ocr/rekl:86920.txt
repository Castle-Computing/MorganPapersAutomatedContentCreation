Dear Mr. Hearst:

Last year, and the year before, and the year before, I mentioned to you half jokingly 
that the firm who had the contract for the marble risers and treads of the main circular 
stairs insisted on at least delivering their material and being paid for this part of 
their contract.

We have kept ordering of this firm bath room linings, a travertine floor, etc. and paying
 on them so as to keep the account a live one - but now they insist on a substantial 
 payment which is impossible to meet out of a budget that has not been sufficient to 
 cover more than operating expenses this year.

I hate to bother you with it, but it is not quite as though we had not taken it up
 before.

Enclosed is a copy of their last letter on the subject.  The contract was made in 
April 1928 and the material was ready for delivery in 1929 and was delivered to the 
San Simeon warehouse in October, 1931.

As always,

Yours truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
