137 RIVERSIDE DRIVE, NEW YORK NY

HAVE LOCATED POMEGRANATES NEAR LINDSAY WHICH SOUND PROMISING.  WILL BE IN FRESNO ON OTHER WORK NEXT WEEK AND COULD GO OVER.  SHALL I GET THEM IF RIGHT SHAPE.  IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO BOX AND SHIP.  RECEIVED YOUR GARDEN AND ORCHARD LETTERS ANNOTATED REPORT.  YOU HAVE MAD WISHES VERY CLEAR.  PORTER SAYS IMPOSSIBLE TO GIVE NAY TIME ON DETAIL WORK UNTIL AFTER FIRST APRIL.
