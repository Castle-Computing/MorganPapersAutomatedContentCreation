Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Sliding doors between the new Entrance Hall and the refectory seem so awkward ( on account of a post in the wall of the passage projecting out somewhat that as a solution would you consider doors folding on themselves (to have rollers on bottom and guides above ) as per sketch, the last door to have a pivot hinge like the old Arabian doors in House C.  They would block the door (B) when open full, but then the door (A) would be in operation.

Work is progressing well, -- the walls up to the second floor having been poured.  It is necessary to wait until this concrete is set before pouring the great beams.  The work is of fine quality.  Mr. Huber, our consulting engineer whom I took up with me last week, says it is as fine a piece of concrete work as he ever saw.

The orchards are budding out beautifully -- also the citrus -- enough bank planting will be in for you to see what thrives and tell us from its behavior this season what you want planted in quantity -- it will serve as an experimental station this year.

Sincerely yours,
JM-deM
