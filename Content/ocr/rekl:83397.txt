Dear Mr. Hearst:

It was a beautiful winter day on the Hill yesterday - a day spent following up small 
items chiefly.  The theatre is stripped and I arranged for a wood and paper covering-in 
of wall and roof openings.  There is a good deal to do yet on the projection room 
equipment.

Today I have word from Mr. and Mrs. Byne that they arrive in San Francisco this week
 end.  If you are up on the Hill Sunday, may I bring them up?  It is their first 
 California experience.  They seem much excited in anticipation. over it. 

Would you have any objection to their seeing photographs in the office of your 
collections?

Yours very truly,
