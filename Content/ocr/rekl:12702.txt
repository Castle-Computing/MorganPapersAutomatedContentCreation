Dear Miss Morgan

I went twice to the studio of W P French and Co today at Mr. Hearsts request.  He wanted me to pick out some covering material for the gold and ivory chair, because he does not like the Kreis sample of old embroidery designs applied to new material.  I was unable to find anything which I thought suitable that would at the same time please him in its design.  I picked out the nearest things I could find.  I found a lot of stuff in red and yellow that might do for the green and gold chairs of B.  I know whether they have been taken care of or not.  Mr. Hearst said that they have.  Mr Hearst had to postpone his morning appointment with me until evening, when I went again to the antique dealers and segregated, from a large assortment, the pieces I thought would interest him.  They had brought out many fine embroideries.  I guessed correctly as to what would interest him (not a difficult thing to do ) but I would not recommend any of it for the A chairs.  He selected some material in a large pattern of red velvet on a silvery toned satin background.  I was beautiful material but I had to tell him I thought it was altogether unsuitable and he submitted to my judgment (which, alas, is usually wrong ) He did not buy it , but bought $5000 worth of wonderful embroideries (4 pieces ) I would have liked to have outbid him on one of them.  He said we could make places for them.  One was 45 feet of long valance belonging with a set of 8 or 10 embroidered pilasters with caps and bases.  He thought we could make 2 bed canopies of it.  It would be good for that, but I regretted the separating of it from the pilaster.  I did not see how he had the heart to do it.  The whole combination would make a magnificent room, but of course there is no place for it in the main building with the tapestries unless we
used it in the gun room.  I did not suggest such use of it.  It just occurred to me as I write the material was said to have come from Portugal, and it is red with gold and silver and a little blue.
 
Another piece was of an ivory satin background embroidered in silver, gold, rose and blue.  The pattern was a central beriboned escutcheore with birds and  a flowering arrabesque.  The upper part was doubled with valances of finer embroidery showing a small Spanish coat of arms at each end.  The piece measured about 8'-6"x3'-0".  The piece I coveted was a bed spread or wall hanging in a rosy apricot color with a soft blue bland in the border and a ground of animals in yellow beautifully composed it is, perhaps, from Portugal.

Before we left he bought some damask which he thought might do for the A chairs it was brought forth at the last moment.  It is very good.  I ventured the opinion that it was not lively enough. (It is a bluish green pattern on a sort of silvery gray background), but he scornfully regretted my criticism.  Perhaps a bright binding would "make it sing"

The 4th piece of the $5000 lot was a fine valance of red and gold 19 ft long and about 2'-6 wide with Spanish coat of arms. Mr Hearst plans to use it on a bed, once the property of Caruso, which he has bought for his room.  He has new bed for Mrs Hearst also (gold)

I had a free hand sketch suggestion for the treatment of the rear entrance which he thought was very good.  I had given him three of a different sort yesterday making in 2 of them a principal feature of the door with smaller windows flanking it.  The third was  broad flattened arch treatment similar to that between refectory and breakfast room.  We agreed that such a treatment would not be good.  This fourth, which he considered a good solution , went back to the 
four arch scheme, but with heavier columns than those of the antique show on the elevation and arches recalling those above. The middle two openings were doors; the others windows.

Mr Hearst thinks the Antique arches we had in the above location could be used in wall between loggia and sitting room of royal suite.  He now likes the arch and glass treatment of that wall, although he was emphatically opposed at first, but he wants the arches treated as above- middle two doors, the others windows and does not care whether you use antique arches or make new ones.
