Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The day before Thanksgiving was spent "On Top".  Mr. Rossi has the wood forms for the bell tower story of the towers almost ready for pouring, also the upper part of the staircase towers and is hauling rock and sand for these.  We hope to have the towers poured by Christmas.  The garden and orchard work is going on for the new season.  There were masses of bougainvillea in flower, and still much loveliness in the gardens.  A storm was coming up with wind when I left.

I have your telegram in regard to cutting down the camp and expenses from Christmas to May.  As reported along, I have pressed the work steadily on the heavy construction of the Main Building, expending what was needed to do this at the cost of letting other work wait, and putting off getting more decorative items under way, and anything also that required immediate payments, because it was evident that we could not put in frames and glass or roof tile, etc. while the danger from construction water and scaffold, hoists, etc. continued.  So I put in orders for the tile roofing, frames, plumbing fixtures, brass pipes, etc. and for the winter and spring planting with he proviso that we would take delivery and make payments spaced over January, February and March.  This was also so as to have material when we started up again.  Probably I was wrong, but it seemed practical.

It will be necessary in order to do the orchard and hill planting and garden work to have, except for the holidays proper,

(1) Gillespie and two teamsters
(2) Keep and two men
(3) Webb and two men
(4) Cook, dish-washer and flunky
(5) Mechanic and helper ( who does all truck and machinery repair and upkeep)
(6) Electrician and handy man
(7) House butler (Robert)

Please return for file
Please (?)
OK
OK
(8) One driver
(9) Two laborers should be kept for winter emergencies on roads, to trees,             
      etc.

All the above by the month.  The mechanic and electrician might be let go but are quite as good in their way as Webb and Keep, and were as hard to sort out and get.

As long as there is this much camp the addition of Mr. Hadly and helper if we want to keep him this year, (and he would be hard to replace ) and five to seven laborers and say five carpenters would allow work on the new bedrooms in the houses, some fountain and ground work, etc. as weather permitted and preliminary work on the Main Building such as furring, blocking, etc. that would make the work go more rapidly and smoothly when a fuller force came on again.

If you think it best to let all but the garden and orchard men go, I will plan that way.

Yours very truly,
s/Julia Morgan

[Notes]

OK. Keep all that are useful but don't attempt more work than we can do during rainy season.
