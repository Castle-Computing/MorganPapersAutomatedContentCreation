La Cuesta Encantada
(written in date - January 11, 1925)

Would like to extend the gardens and have big architectural effects in the gardens -- flights of steps -- cascades -- fountains, gates -- columns -- bases for statuary -- large sun dials, clocks, etc. hot houses, aviaries -- all designed as parts of architectural and landscape unit.

I think we should have a second or lower wall with fruit gardens between it and first wall -- walks, steps, blowers, arbors, vistas, terraces, etc.

I think since we are going to use the same water over and over we should have the water system on a very large scale providing plenty of fountains, lakes, pools, cascades, and every old thing.

The garden reservoir should be on some high place perhaps half way up reservoir hill and the water should run all through the gardens under gravity and then be forced back again to the reservoir -- 300 feet is about the limit from bottom to top, isn't it?  Length doesn't matter.

I think there should be some little temples at various view points along the new lower wall where walkers can stop and rest.
There should be imposing entrance gates, cascades, statuary niches, cloisters, etc.

Would like to plan for extending the orchard and some definite scheme for treeplanting in clumps.

I want to carry the lower wall to the juncture of the roads below (west) of Chinese Hill.  We don't need a gate there but we should have pillars and lights and tress planted in effective combinations on the east and the west angles of the wood.  I want to carry a road to the north of orchard hill all around the hill to meet the present road south of orchard hill where the old road used to meet it.  Then I want to move the upper gate down to that point.

I think there should be planting on the angels north and south of the gate.  I think there should be some architectural feathers in these various points -- seats and perhaps a shrine, etcetera.

The next point is the lower gate at the trough. I want to make the space between the upper gate and the lower gate a deer park and at this lower gate I think there should be a lodge and hay barn and barns for the deer and buffalo.  I believe this will be the natural place for all this if it can be made attractive. The deer park would be above (north) and the 
buffalo and elk park below (south) and all these animals could be tended by the men who would live in this lodge.  I think the barns and houses could be built to be good looking Spanish and give an impressive entrance to the enclosure.

I have the fence plan pretty throughly made now and it leaves a lot of space south of our houses on the hill top that will be free of animals and that we can use as a wild wood or natural picnic garden and help out with some planting like the sequoias.  We can also plant fruits as you suggested and we can make groves of interesting trees like cork oaks and various flowering trees.  I think we should put thermometers to see what the temperature is in these places to determine the planting, etc.

Finally there are the Jersey barns, Jersey dairy and cattle fields; also the horse barn and horse fields; a big hay barn on the hill; the kennels, etc.

I have decided to keep the Jerseys on the hill as they dont have to be fed much -- a dozen truck loads of hay will last them a year.  The horses eat as much hay.  One truck working a week could bring up all the hay needed for horses and Jerseys.  Therefore I want to build barns for the Jerseys, the horses and the hay and the pups -- something like we originally 
planned. I think the place we originally selected is probably the best if the wind isn't too strong there. Anyhow we can have a protected patio and the cows can graze on one side of the hill or the other according to how the wind is blowing.  Then we can plant some wind breaks -- olives make  fine ones.

The chickens will have to go below.  They dont do well on the hill.  Furthermore we will have to build the ranch dairy and some other things as agreed upon -- below.

What shall we do with garage hill?  Shall we put the horse barn there or shall we put that down near the Jersey barn and the hay barn?  Or shall we put the cow barn and the horse barn and the hay barn and dogs and everything on garage hill?

Or shall we put an observatory on garage hill -- with a big telescope and study the stars in our old age?  Or shall we put the observatory on reservoir hill?  Of course reservoir hill is the ideal spot but rather hard to get to, still it would give us another point of interest and a place to go to see.

Then the water could be made a pleasant adjunct.  What think?  Sort of romantic isn't it!  Reminds one of Washington Irving's "Tales of the Alhambra", The Astrologer and the fair maiden," etc.

Now we drop way down to a vegetable garden.  The utilitarian takes the place of the spiritual.  I think a good way to raise ‘em is either in the orchards or in the little hollow at the cross roads west of Chinese hill or on a plowed plot of ground on the flats in front of Casa del Mar way down below the sequoias.

I guess thats all except that there is money in wine grapes, paper shell walnuts, the finest almonds and olives and peaches and pomgranates and garlic.  We ought to plant ‘em.
