January 26, 1925.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
La Cuesta Encatada,
San Simeon, California.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
We were surprised today by a sight draft to cover the Gibraltar-New York shipping charges on the Byne ceilings, letter explaining which is enclosed, also a Pacific Steamship Company notice that they have arrived and are in the customs here. I paid the draft out of your special fund, that being available.
To get the boxes out of customs we need the Consular Invoices mailed to you at Los Angeles November 28th with Mr. Byne's letter. Mr. Willi-combe had it.
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
