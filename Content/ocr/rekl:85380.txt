MR MAYBECKS SUGGESTION AFTER LOOKING AT PHOTOGRAPH OF MODEL IS THAT AT DISTANCE OF 
SEVERAL MILES ON THE BAY MONUMENT MAY LOOK LIKE A CHIMNEY SUGGEST SIT WOULD BE TESTED 
OUT BY A TEMPORARY STRUCTURE OF EQUIVALENT MASS COVERED WITH BURLAP OR ANY CHEAP 
MATERIAL STOP THINKS IF THIS WERE DONE THE PUBLIC WOULD DECIDE THE QUESTION CONSIDERS 
THE MATTER IMPORTANT ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY THIS EXPENSE IN ORDER TO GIVE PEOPLE 
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE THE MASS HE THINKS DETAIL OF DESIGN IS UNIMPORTANT AND THAT 
RELATION OF MASS TO HILLTOP AND DISTANCE FROM WHICH IT WILL BE SEEN USUALLY FROM BELOW
 IS MAIN CONSIDERATION HE SAYS THIS PROCEDURE IS VERY COMMON PRACTICE ON SIMILAR 
 MONUMENTAL WORK IN EUROPE
