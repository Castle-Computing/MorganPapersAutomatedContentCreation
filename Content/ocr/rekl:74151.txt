Dear Miss Morgan:

I am enclosing check for $6460, as requested.  

2.  I will not be able to go to the ranch Sunday, as I have engagements here Saturday and Sundsy.

I can go Monday night and be there Tuesday.

Would it be agreeable to you to meet me at the ranch Tuesday instead of Sunday?

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
