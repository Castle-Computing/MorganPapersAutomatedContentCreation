Dear Miss Morgan:

We hereby transcribe Mr. Hearst's letter of Sept. 17th. just received.

Sept. 17, 1929.

"Dear Mr. Rossi:

1.	Please give the men the best food and the best cook you can possibly get.  We do 
not have very luxurious quarters for them and we ought to have a very good kitchen.

2.	I forgot to speak to Miss Morgan about the braces for the cypress trees.  The winter
 storms will soon be here and will you please ask Miss Morgan to let you put in the 
 braces as soon as possible.

3.	I also would like while you are making the North Terrace to have you make the north
 wall complete, with boxes for the cypress, so we can move the additional cypress in at
  the first opportunity.

4.	I discussed with Miss Morgan the location of the two deodars.  They are to go in
 line with the axis of the stairs and they probably will be moved north somewhat in 
 addition.  Miss Morgan made a rough sketch of the ruble walls which are to erected 
 to sustain the dirt terrace on which the two deodars will rest.  She will probably 
 give you that.  I would like to have the deodars moved as soon as convenient.

5.	The locations of the four palms has to be decided.  Miss Morgan and I felt we could 
place two of them but I do not know where she intends to place the other two.

6.	There are a whole lot of small palms and some cypress and other plants around the 
hill in boxes.  I wanted them planted somewhere, every blessed one of them, even if we 
have to dig them up again later, because they will die in the boxes.  Please give some 
to Mr. Keep and please have the gardener plant some, but get them all planted.

7.	If you have all the data for the north terrace I wish you would hurry that through 
to completion as soon as possible.  I think you have gone over every detail with Miss
 Morgan and all you have to do is get the necessary drawings from her.  I would like 
 this big work cleaned up promptly so that all matters in the neighborhood of the front 
 of the house will be finished and will look well.

8.	Miss Morgan and I agreed on a location for the molder's house and the other things 
that are on the flat below A.  I would like these moved as soon as convenient .  They are 
a noisy nuisance where they are.  Moreover the accumulation of trash there makes very 
unpleasant surroundings.

9.	I spoke to Miss Morgan about the indoor pool and she thought it was good to partly 
finish it so it could be used this winter.  I am extremely anxious to have this done, 
because I do not believe the indoor tennis court and the incidental construction to
 that will be finished for a year and all of that time, probably this winter and next 
 winter, we would be deprived of the use of the indoor pool unless it were finished
  in a temporary manner to allow us to use it.  Of course the only alternative is to 
  finish the indoor pool completely and trust that the construction above it will not
   injure the work that is put in below.  But one way or the other I want the use of 
   that pool and I also want the water heated.

Sincerely yours,

W.R.Hearst"

Please dont neglect these various propositions.  You might also ask Miss Morgan when 
she plans to erect the colonnades and the temple at the pool.  These things are not as 
important as the others but it would be very pleasant to have the pool be and look 
finished.

W.R.H.

P.S. Again I spoke to Mr. Joy about showers and toilets in lower A.  He is ill and you 
will have to take this matter up with Miss Morgan.  I also spoke about the window in 
lower C to the north.  I hope you can do this and make it big as is safe.  The room is 
so dark.  It would be an agreeable room if lighted.

W.R.H.

These are your sailing orders when confirmed by Miss Morgan.  I have already spoken to 
her about most of them - maybe all of them.

W.R.H."

Very truly yours,

s/ CC Rossi
