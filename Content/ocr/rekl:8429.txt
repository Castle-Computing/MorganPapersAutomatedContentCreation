Dear Mr. Hearst:

It seems to me that you will always need a warehouse of considerable size, although not as large as needed to care for the building period, with a repair and shipping rooms.  I would think if the site at the turn is not large enough for stables and garage and small machine or between this site and the greenhouse location, - handy, yet not in sight generally.  This site has the advantage also of making it possible to build at once, as not entailing other decisions.

More than once last year I debated the question of supply clerk, but was afraid he would not have enough to do to keep him busy,- ships were so far between, and I did not want to provide  any "easy jobs" on top. I will try for a suitable man who will keep the men's time and payrolls as well.

There is a buying, checking, delivery-receipting system in use for construction materials etc.- that has proved itself, but I sent up only what was needed on account of having no check on it once there.  Supplies of a general nature like hardware, electrical materials, goods, could be brought to better advantage in larger quantities.

I will bring up a plat plan and paper and work up the general scheme with you.  I will have to be in Pasadena two days next week, but any other time you wish.

There is a complete list here and in Mr. Bogart's office of all the goods from the last shipment warehoused in San Francisco that have been shipped up.  It took one man's almost entire time for several weeks to locate and identify these packages, owing , first, to their being scattered all over the warehouse; second, the nature of the contents not being findable except by opening in many cases, and third, the many crates, etc.  bearing the same number or series of numbers.  It will be the greatest relief to have the photographs (with scales) but it will still be necessary to have a better method of identifying the boxes.
May I talk over the gardener question with you on the next visit?  It is one of several angles.

Sincerely yours,
