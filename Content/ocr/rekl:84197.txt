Dear Miss Morgan:

I should think the curtains for the parlor of the gothic suite should be of a beige 
or tan type.

I think they will have to go above the window frame instead of inside the enclosure; 
otherwise the windows could not be opened.

2.  Will you please ask Mr. Byne to exercise more care in packing.  He may charge 
extra cost to me.  I would rather pay for good packing than receive things in bad 
condition.

3.  I do not think it would take a great deal of trouble to finish the tower rooms 
promptly; and we need those two rooms.

4.  Have you heard anything further form Chris McGregor about the details and 
dimensions of the ceilings he has which might be available for the billiard room?  
I have not.

5.  Can we not now put in the bowling alley under the theatre?  That would give 
us good exercise for the wintry days when the tennis court is not available.

6.  Some of the Los Angeles people who are up here have tennis courts,- Matt Moore, 
Cedric Gibbons, and others.  They all agree that the tennis court can be lighted at 
night very effectively by flood lights of not less than a thousand kilowats each.

These lights should not go on the ends but should go on the sides, at elevations of 
from 15 to 20 feet, 15 feet being consider sufficient for thousand-wat lamps.  Higher 
power lamps at greater height might be better but are not necessary.

The lighting in this way is said to be quite as satisfactory as daylight, but the 
court must be lighted as a flying field is lighted,-- by flood lights, and not by 
ordinary bulbs and reflectors.

7.  As soon as the billiard room is ready, I would like to get billiard and pool 
tables to furnish it.

I also have some stained glass which could be used in that room if you think desirable.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
