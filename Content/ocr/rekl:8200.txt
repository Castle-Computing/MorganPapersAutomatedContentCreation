Dear Mr. Hearst:

The interior of a small Moorish room, from French & Co. , that you spoke of over the telephone, is billed by him as a 15th century Spanish carved wood ceiling.  I  enclose a plan, and have typewritten the description on French's bill.  You may want to send this plan to Miss Morgan.  This ceiling is in the carload lot that left here April 23rd.

I am checking up a list I got from Samuels this afternoon.

Sincerely,
s/ L J OReilly
