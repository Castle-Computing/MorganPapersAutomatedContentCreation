Dear Mr. Hearst:

All you say about the garden condition is more than true, and I am sorry.

I do not know of any landscape gardener in or around San Francisco whose work is understanding enough to make it seem worth while to try.  The only good gardeners I have found in the last year have families, and object to the conditions offered.  If you wanted Bruce Porter, who made the survey for you some years ago,  and who is an artist, to come down once a month, and provide a more "puttering" type of gardener, one for each kind of growth, or one for each main part of the garden, gathered from among his many local connections, a solution might come.

There is also a young woman named Florence Jong working around Los Angeles from Pasadena, who has done some very lovely work, on of course a much smaller scale.  She has the real touch.  If she, or some one like her, could be up for whole week or ten days at a time in each month, going into every detail of planting and training, and colors, etc., taking as it were all but the maneul work from the gardener, such a man as Macklin might do.  In the meantime I have told him again as to keeping the proper balance between the pink geraniums and the lantana, thinning out the jungles, etc. etc., and will go over in detail enough this trip to have the place in better shape - but it will not foresee what color scheme will be our despair when the borders etc. flower.  The yellow callas nearly gave me heart failure last week.

Yours very truly,
