October 30th, 1931

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The highboy at the Jolon Ranch was made here in San Francisco, about twenty years 
ago, and is a nice piece.  It is hard to tell just how nice things are from 
photographs, but you marked it as usable there.  Most of the balance of Hacienda 
things seem to fragile or too valuable for ranch use, Wyntoon having taken the more 
usual items.

There are many lovely and interesting quilts and other personal things of your 
mother's, very carefully packed in trunks in the vault under the Social Room.  It 
gave Mr. O'Brien the keys to these trunks for you.  I will get the quilts from Jolon 
back.

Mr. Huber has been away, but will be on the Hill Sunday to go over the salt water 
plant in detail.  We had better make a study of all the hot water and steam needs 
as they will all center in the service building.

I will bring new studies Sunday of the Billiard Room.

The bath rooms were "twin", as to mirrors, but will substitute whatever you wish.  
Should have asked, but the details developed while you were away.

As always,

Yours very truly,
