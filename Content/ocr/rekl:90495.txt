Dear Mr. Willicombe:
	
	The two San Francisco ceilings Mr. Hearst released
to send East are on their way, including certain articles
returned from the deYoung Museum also released by Mr. Hearst.
It took three cars to take those unusually large ceilings, the 
furniture just used to fill the chinks. The total valuation on 
these three cards is $44,685.00.

	Mr. Williams could not tell which ceioings could
be best packed together from the point of view of sandwiching
well, - will send as soon as determined. The valuation will be 
around $25,000.00.

	We have made lists of articles Mr. Hearst has
approved sending under the following headings:

Stone Elements				$25,000.00
Mantels					 	 65,148.00
Ceilings					164,075.00
Doors and Frames		 	 14,165.00

$331,249.50

4 carloads already shipped,
   (April 1st to 4th), about 65,500.00
$265,749.50

Now a questionnaire:

1. Does this cover what you need for Mr. Konta?

2. Shall we send by subjects, such as "Ceilings," "Mantels," 
etc., until each group is moved, using the small "collections" 
to fill in car chinks, or send as convenient to 
get out?

3. Shall we go right on car-loading? We can easily.

As always,
