Dear Mr. Hearst:

Any decision you come to in regard to Mr. Rossi I will, of course, fall in with 
cheerfully, but believe that not carrying through will make him doubly hard to work 
with - he is so unbelievably revengeful and finds so many ingenious ways for indirect 
expression of his sentiments.

I may be unreasonably tired of operating with a constant sense of contrary purpose, 
and not see conditions fairly or clearly as your fresh eye can.

If you do decide not to keep Mr. Rossi, I think the man we discussed Friday would do.  
He is equally good as an engineer, is experienced, has left a record for good work 
and good will behind wherever he has been and is in demand even in these times.

Enclosed is a letter from Mr. Rossi received this morning.  I realize he would not 
wish to go at any time.

As always,

Yours very truly,
