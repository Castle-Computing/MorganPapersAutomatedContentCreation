Dear Miss Morgan:

Please note enclosed letter from Mr. Addison-- and kindly return at your convenience for files

I do not know what this fencing will cost but it would seem to be necessary.  I am anxious to have all the fences made coyote proof-- the outside as well as the inside fences-- because in this way we have double protection for the weaker animals.

The gates should also be made coyote proof, so that protection will be complete.

The animals as now arranged are very interesting and scenically effective.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
