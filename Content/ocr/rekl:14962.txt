December 1, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.  I am sorry that, not knowing you were going to be so homesick I mailed you Mr. Byne's latest letters in regard to possible palaces with photographs.  I am enclosing copies of the letters, but there were no duplicate photographs. The first letter, photographs and blue prints were of the cloister.

2.  Enclosed are the photographs of the Howard Studio columns.  They are certainly handsome but too small in scale for the Esplanade motifs, and at present there is no place especially needing them.

3.  Mr. Fairchild showed me your telegram concerning the Hacienda warehouse - I will do as you ask in regard to looking after the moving of its contents, but before starting it it might save considerably in handling and warehousing to go over the "deposits" as quite a good bit of the material you may  not want to house permanently.  Perhaps I can do this before seeing you and bring you the segregated lists.

Sincerely yours,
