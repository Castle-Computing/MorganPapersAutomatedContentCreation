My dear Miss Morgan:-

I note that the letter from Mildred Stapley Byne says that a number of cornices from San Guessa Missions with carved pins, etc.  have been sold, and the finest remaining one, the Casa Valle Santorio, has also been sold and awaits the end of the war to be taken down and boxed.

Inasmuch as this lady says that she and her husband have gone into the antique business, maybe she could trace this cornice and if found try to buy it for us.  Also, please correspond with the lady and ask her to act as agent for us.  We will want a tremendous lot of stuff for the big house, bath house, etc. and probably we could do much better from her than from the average antiquary.

Two.  I think I will ask Mr. Roy Sommers, a nice young man on the ranch who has charge of the warehouse, to overlook things in a general way for me on the hill, coming up every day or two to see how things are going on.  Mr. Joy not being here and you naturally being able to visit the place only occasionally on account of the distance, I think some representative of that kind is necessary to see that everything is going ahead as fast as possible.  I am really afraid that the completion of the smaller houses and other work will take so long that we will not be able to start the big house.  If you feel that we cannot get the big house reasonably well up by  summer, I would rather wait  until after the summer vacation to start it, because the excavating and the laying of the foundations and other disagreeable parts would interfere greatly with out pleasant occupancy of the hill.

Three.  I have been over the fire places with Mr. Hadley.  He thinks we can make the two fire places in "C" draw sufficiently well by making the actual fire place a little deeper in the back.  This he is proceeding to do by putting the bricks in sidewise, etc.  and then by putting the hood at the top of the opening which will begin just below the marble and come down for about five inches projecting as it descends until it reaches a projection of about three inches.  This will make the opening according yo Hoyle a little wider than it is high.  this will keep the smoke from puffing out in the room as it does now.  Mr. Hadley is strong in belief that  a little greater height to the chimneys, taking them above the towers, will also help.  I do not know anything about that myself, but I suggest that the chimneys be made as high as they  can be without interfering with the architectural effect.

In the house "B" bedrooms he will widen the fire  places by cutting the side marbles in half, as you and I agreed upon, make the fire place as deep as possible and have the smoke chamber so that it will not interfere with the front wall, as you suggested.  Mr. Hadley is sure this can be done.  All the fire places will carry dampers and I think these have been ordered for all of them.  If not, they should be.

I am going to have another talk with Mr. Hadley about the fire place in the parlor of "B", but I imagine we will need a front piece similar to what we put in the fire place int he parlor of "C".

I have telegraphed Mr. O'Reilly to get news of the two mantel pieces from French's.   They should be here.  I understand we are now going to 
put the bed in the alcove of Mrs. Hearst's room and the small fire place in the room just back of where it is now.  I do not know what can be done with my room until the fireplaces get here.  I think my fire place is pretty big and may not permit of that treatment.

I am enclosing some photographs of a lot of mantels submitted from Italy.  I am afraid very much that they are fakes.  They certainly look like it as the character of the carving is not right.  I have sent to find out about them.  THe oil jars, however, look good and I ordered them, seven in all.  we can use them on the wall and elsewhere.

Very Sincerely,
