Dear Mr. Hearst:

A fairly simple change in the mountings of the bell hammers has eliminated entirely 
the operating noises - and the carillon rings true.  The men expected to leave 
tonight, and I think have done their work well.

Professor Weichel, the Berkeley Chimes-master, says the piano music rolls are too 
complicated to bring the finest from the set.  I have made inquiries as to 
"repertoire" and will report next visit.

I will be in Los Angeles on Friday and will bring the tentative layout on the 
Grande Salle de Bal, in case you would like to go over these and a few Hill 
questions.

Yours very truly,
