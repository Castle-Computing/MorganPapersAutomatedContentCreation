THE PLAN FOR IMPROVING VIEW SIDE OF BUNGALOW B IS SOMETHING SIMILAR TO PLAN FOR IMPROVING C WHICH I HAVE LATELY TELEGRAPHED IT CONTEMPLATES PUTTING AN OPEN PORCH BEFORE SITTINGROOM ON VIEW SIDE 8 OR 10 FEET DEEPT ALSO DEEPENING PORCHES BEFORE BEDROOMS SO THAT THEY REACH FORWARD TO ONE HALF THE DEPTH OF THE CENTRAL PORCH THEN HAVE STAIRS DESCEND FROM EACH SIDE OF CENTRA PORCH AND BEFORE.
SIDE PORCHES DOUBLING BACK BEFORE CENTRAL PORCH AFTER MANNER OF STAIRCASE IN CATHEDRAL OF BURGOS THE ESCALERA DORODA BIG DECORATIVE DOOR BELOW INTO LOWER ROOM AND TERRACE GARDEN SUPPORTED BY CONCRETE WALLS AND RAIL IN FRONT OF COURSE THE DEEPENED UPPER SIDE PORCHES MIGHT BE LOGGIAS OR THE ADDED CENTRAL PORCHES ON BUNGALOW B AND TO HAVE CENTRAL CONVERED LOGGIA ONLY ON HOUSE C THE OUTSIDE STAIRS FOR HOUSE C SHOULD BE LIKE THOSE OF HOUSE A AND NOT LIKE THOSE OF HOUSE B HOPE THIS IS CLEAR

W R HEARST.
