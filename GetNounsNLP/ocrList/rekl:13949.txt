September 13, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is Mr. Huber's report on Portuguese and Pat Garrity Springs, which is certainly conclusive.  It makes it evident that a development north of the present ranch site would have to depend on the dam for water supply.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
