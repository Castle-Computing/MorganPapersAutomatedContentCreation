Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you for the Burnett sketch and clipping -- we will work it out to the criticizing stage for your eye.

Enclosed is one of the new gate cards, the photographs for which will be made by Mr. Williams (the warehouse man).  A duplicate photograph, with full history of each individual so far as obtainable, will be kept in a card file here for reference.  This would seem to carry out your suggestion and should be simple to keep up once established.  Do you think this would be satisfactory?

I am planning to be in San Simeon Tuesday.

Yours very truly,
