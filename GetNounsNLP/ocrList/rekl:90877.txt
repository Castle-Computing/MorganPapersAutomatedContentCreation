Dear Miss Morgan,
I cabled to build new Giraffe field with high wall retaining the roan on north side thus 
Giraffe 
retaining wall
road 
and to build the house for the giraffes on the south side of the field beyond the present fence and as for south as we can conveniently go. The field can possibly be levelled somewhat - I dont know whether there is one I or two - as we dont want the giraffesto break the stills which they go walking around on.
I also cabled about the taping. He must have a wallow and I think [the?] best place for him is near where the present giraffe house is as there is a spring near there. He should be seen from the road of course.
I think these two places should be built while I am away. The road to the [Bunett?] can wait until these are done.
I told Mr. Joy to proceed with the chicken house which is now not so much a palace and can be built within reason. I think this can be completed before winter and we can have a real place for our chickens.
I also told Mr. Rossi to enlarge the animal [illegible] on a temporary basis. He has my sketch. This also should be quickly done 
Now
Miss Morgan you must stop working so hard. All your friends will be really angry with you if you dont. You haventany right to destroy yourself and that is exactly what you are doing. You wouldnt treat an engine the way you treat yourself. It isnt right and it isnt good practise. You dont get the best work or the most work that way you cant race all the time. You must rest sometime.
Please take the boat and come abroad for a couple of months. We will see a lot of things and get a lot of ideas - and we will have a good time
Sincerely WR Hearst.
