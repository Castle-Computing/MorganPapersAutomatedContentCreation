Dear Miss Morgan:

	Herewith by registered mail I am 
sending you the photographs/prints, etc., of things 
belonging to Mr. Hearst at the San Francisco
museums, -- which you sent him in your letter
of May 4, 1938.

	In your letter you referred to the missing
photograph of the wooden St. Christopher. Please
surely include that item in the inventory. 

	I have asked Mr. Williams at San Simeon to 
send you the originals of the varguenos, which Mr. 
Hearst gave him some time ago to copy. 

	Many thanks for the great cooperation
	you are giving in this inventory situation
	-- and for that million dollar list
	of material incorporated in San Simeon 
	construction. 
	
		Best Wishes 
		
		J Willicombe
