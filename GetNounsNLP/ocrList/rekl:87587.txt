Dear Miss Morgan:

I think the Gothic windows at the East end of the third floor study are very beautiful.  
It would have been nice if we could have gotten a foot or so of wainscot, or whatever 
you call it, before the window began; but it is very nice as it is, and I do not see 
any reason to cut off the windows or spoil the effect by a guard grille.

I like the idea of the whole end of the room being open.  However, I find that the 
doors we selected are not quite adapted to the best display of this magnificent window 
end of the room.  They cut it down on the sides and from the top, particularly from the 
top.

I think we should have, as we once proposed, doors, or rather Gothic arches, there 
which are wider and considerably higher than the present doors, and which gave a good 
view of the end windows from the larger room.

We can use these doors in other places; in fact, we have real need for them in other 
places.

But the Gothic arches would certainly be better, in my opinion, in the study.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco.
