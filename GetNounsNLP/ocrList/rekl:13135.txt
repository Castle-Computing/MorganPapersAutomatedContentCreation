Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.
Dear Mr. Hearst,
Mr. Rossi has graded off a space for the temporary hay barn and as soon as the carpenters have finished this stage of concrete forms, will rush it up. I went around o the spot you select-ed for the staff housing and set its possibilities -- in fact like it very much indeed. As soon as some photographs are here we took to work over, I will send the sketches.
OK
The farm group will be seen prominently from the new turn-around of the drive and should make a very attractive picture. I am so very glad you have put it over on this ridge. The studies have taken some time to make practical and up to date in detail, but will be ready to send to you shortly. 
Yes Very good please think [illegible] very glad you like it.
The new location for the camp is also work-ing out well and will be put through as soon as the barn is done, so that we can do the grading about the main building and level the esplanade before the heavy rains.
Yours very truly,
Julia Morgan
