March 30, 1935.

Dear Mr. LeFeaver: (Confirming our telephone call.)

I am forwarding B. B. Gates bill for twenty yards of crushed rock.  This is the 
last rock needed for the colonnade pour.  Because of the delay in the old account 
I hop you will help him out by making prompt payment of this one.

Mr. Hearst is leaving today unless he changes his mind before this afternoon.

In a general conversation regarding present work he asked for another metal warehouse 
right away.  He really wants the concrete warehouse but the present plans call for 
wrecking the old one and we would have little extra space.  He wouldn't have it right 
away and it would cost a lot more money.

He wants to erect two but has agreed to one at a time and wait a little on the next 
one.

I am practically ready for the steel in the colonnades.  John has a few more panels 
to cast.  I can hardly understand why they are not all ready since he started on 
January 7th.

If our new truck comes we will haul our own sand from Monterey.  I expect it in two 
weeks.  It will take longer than that with the steel.

He wants us to start a small crew and pour a few more beams at the Pergola.  
Fortunately we have 100 bird heads cast and three men will make a big showing.  
He suggests we order at least 200 columns for the summer but I think he'll be pleased 
with 100.  It would cost quite a little to get footings for the 200 in addition to
 beams.
He hopes we can have the Study completed by his return.  We should do it complete 
with painting with proper crew.  He does not want to change the beams now.  He bought 
new rugs that just match the ceiling and so we may not have to touch them..ho..ho.

As regards to the small tower rooms.  I am enclosing his note.  I mentioned that I 
could not do much in these towers as very little of the inlay work had been completed. 
 Perhaps I should not do anything on this until Miss Morgan returns.

In regards to his sickness, it started from a cold and confined him to his rooms for
 two weeks.  In fact, to his bed for more than three days with quite a fever.  Many 
 of the people here were quite sick during this period.  Louis Reesing was very bad 
 and lost two weeks.

The weather was quite uncomfortable.  A real rainstorm, a windstorm, three days of 
uncomfortable heat and then more wind.  It was too tough to work on the colonnades 
so I laid the crew off for three days.  Alls fine and everybody well now again.

I believe this covers everything.  I intend to put all carpenters (four) in the Study 
in the morning.  Pete is getting ready this afternoon.  The thing I dislike most is to
 move furniture and cover it up.

Respectfully yours,
