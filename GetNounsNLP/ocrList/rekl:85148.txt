Dear Miss Morgan:

I have looked into the cost of lighting the airport.  It is eight cents an hour or 
approximately eighty cents a day.  This is apparently the maximum cost.

Even the lighting on the Hill does not cost a great deal; but the things that do 
cost are the heaters and the motors and the running of the elevator, and matters 
of that kind.

If we want to save electric current, we must devise ways of cutting down on the 
really costly features.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco

NOTE: The lighting of the field nightly doe snot cost more than 8-cents per hour.  
This includes the border lights and the beacon.  

THE FLOOD LIGHTS HAVE BEEN USED ONLY TWICE IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS AND FOR NOT MORE 
THAN AN HOUR ALTOGETHER AT A COST OF ABOUT FIFTY CENTS.
