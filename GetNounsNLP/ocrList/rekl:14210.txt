Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Ambassador Hotel,
Los Angeles, California.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
Yesterday I deposited in your "special" office account the personal check you gave me at San Simeon December 28th for $15,000. (three months' allowance for pay rolls over and above those of our schedule) and have drawn on it to meet the last two weeks' pay rolls of carvers Mr. Van der Loo, etc. as we have not received our last month's allowance in full and are out of funds, -- $10,000 being yet lacking.
I called on Mr. Bogart Today and he says he will not be able to make it up.
We are being badly pressed by the people to whom we had promised regular monthly payments, on account, on the big construction bills of last summer, (plumbing, mill, cement, etc.), an ar-rangement made with them after talking with you last July, establishing the schedule arrangement.
I explained all this to Mr. Bogart, but he is hard hearted and says he cannot provide the funds, and does not know about January's money.
I dislike to bother you again, but have to --
is always
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
