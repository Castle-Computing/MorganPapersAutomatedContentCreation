Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your letter in regard to the Hill office work I will be glad to take up with you on 
Sunday - and will try to provide the service you wish.

In the case cited however, Mr. Rossi had Mr. Huber's drawings with full explanations 
and notes in ample time, but did not choose to follow them.  It is not a new difficulty.  
Enclosed is a telegram sent Mr. Rossi today.

The Milpitas ranch house was arranged originally for twenty men, -- we made it thirty 
with the extensions you suggested, with other wings that could go on sometime if needed.  
 I will bring the drawings Sunday.

Yours very truly,
