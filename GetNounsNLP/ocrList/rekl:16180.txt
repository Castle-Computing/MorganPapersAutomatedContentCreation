Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
c/o The Ambassador Hotel,
Loo Angeles, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

We have been studying the problem of hot water
for the small houses, especially House "A". The hot
water for this house is supplied by two electric hot
water heaters of 60 gallon capacity each, and each
having two electric heating elements. This gives
a total storage of 120 gallons to supply the six baths
in the house which is much more than is usually allow-
ed for ordinary use.

However, it is possible to put the entire con-
tents of one boiler in one of the large bath tubs but
as this water should be at a temperature of around
150 to 160 degrees. it seems very unlikely that this
would ever occur. However, should the entire contents
of one of the boilers be drawn at one time, it would
require approximately one hour for this boiler of water
to be re-heated.

It has occurred to us that possibly the heating
elements in these boilers are not functioning to full
efficiency and we are having this point looked into.
If we find that the heating elements are in proper work-
ing order, and still greater storage capacity of hot
water is desired, it can quite easily be secured by
placing on additional storage boiler alongside and con-
nected to each of the present boilers, by which means
we could get any storage capacity desired. If we were
to place a 60 gallon storage boiler alongside of each
heater, we would have a total hot water storage for
House "A" of 240 gallons, which would be 40 gallons
for each tub, if they were all filled simultaneously.

We would be glad to have you let us know if you
think that much water would ever be needed.

Very truly yours.
Julia Morgan
