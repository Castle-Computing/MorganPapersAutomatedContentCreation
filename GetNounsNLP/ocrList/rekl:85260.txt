Miss Julia Morgan,
1135 Merchants Exchange,
San Francisco, California.

My dear Miss Morgan:
	
	Mr. Hearst some two weeks ago decided to
turn over payments at the ranch to Piedomont Land and
Cattle Company but subsequentially countermanded this so
that the payment of these bills is under his own 
jurisdiction.

	I had prepared to take over the matter bt
dropped it susequently when I heard from Mr. Hearst
that he wanted to continue to handle it as he did before.

	I would be glad to be of any service possible
but, in the view of his arrangements, I do not want to 
break into it.

	Very sincerely yours,
		John Francis Neylan
