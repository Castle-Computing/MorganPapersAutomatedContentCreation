ADVISE NOT ALTERING BED ROOMS ON ENTRANCE SIDES OF B OR C ADVISE ERECTING PORCHES AND STAIRS ON VIEW SIDES OF HOUSES B AND C AND MAKING THE BED ROOMS ON VIEW SIDE SEEM LONGER BY CONSTRUCTING BIG WINDOWS AND WINDOW SEATS FULL WIDTH OF BED ROOMS TO PROJECT INTO PORCHES IS NOT THIS FEASIBLE WITH BOTH B AND C IF WE MAKE THE PORCHES DEEP ENOUGH THE WINDOWS SHOULD PROJECT FOUR FEET AND THE WINDOW SEATS BE THREE AND ONE HALF
FEET DEEP IF YOU DONT LIKE THE LOGGIA ON HOUSE C DONT MAKE IT BUT IF YOU DO LIKE IT I THINK WE SHOULD MAKE IT TO GET A NEW FEATURE AND A NEW ARCHITECTURAL EFFECT THE WINDOWS OF BED ROOMS COULD PROJECT ON THE TWO PORCHES ON SIDES OF LOGGIA JUST THE SAME
