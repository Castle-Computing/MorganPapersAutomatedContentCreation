Dear Miss Morgan,
Why not put the Romanesque mantel in the celestial sitting room.
I think that would [harmonize?] better than anything else with the surroundings.
2. I bought twenty eight columns, 13th century, from an old French monastery. 
I would like to used them on the refectory windows [illegible] The columns are six feet high. If we made a [sub?] base for the columns to rest on they would fit well and we could get rid of the cross bar entirely. That would make the windows look much better.
On the floor above we could take the existing by arches and divide each into three windows with two columns per arch thus. Of course this outline would not be right but we could certainly use the columns in windows grouped together in threes and requiring two columns for each group. That scheme for both stones would require thirty columns We would have to move two columns which we moved put in obscure places. I don't think the stained glass in the refectory is a very great success. It will take a lot of study and then will perhaps never be as good as the blue sky in the day time and the inquisitive little stars at night peeking in to see what all the racket is about. Therefore I think we should make the plain windows as attractive as possible.I wish we could get the bell piano somewhere downstairs, say in the East lobby or breakfast room.
There it could be played easier - even by the [illegible] when they made the dinner call.
I am afraid we have it in an inconvenient place.
Everything seems to be going well, but slowly everything except the years.
Sincerely 
WR Hearst
