[Letter]

Dear Mr. Willicombe:

The letters opened both contained folded tracings of garden  layouts and Mr. Hearst's notes covering them and other detail  matters. These were probably evident at once. I only called  attention to it because of its happening twice in succession. An  agent from the San Francisco Post Office showed me how the first  one, a linen envelope, had been steamed and opened.

Yours very truly,
