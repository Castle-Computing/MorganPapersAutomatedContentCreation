February 16, 1922.
Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
After keeping the full size work-ing drawings for the marble balustrade, facing, niche, etc., for House A stairway and lower lobby for a month, the Inyo Marble Co. sent word they could not fill the order and were tied up indefinitely.
I am sending you some samples of a stained marble, with cost of, also a sample of another marble actually on hand here with the cost of. If neither of these seem possible, would you consider the balusters of travertine with top and bottom railing of red Sienna like the floor border -- making the niche shell of plaster, gilded, and from the shell down of plain gold mosaic, and the lobby walls of plaster marked off as the walls of upper lobby.
I am more than just disappointed.
We have a figure of $478.00 for the travertine steps from lobby to niche level. As it was so expensive, I thought we could use the yellow and black combination for the landing and steps from landing to lower floor.
I should have sent all this before, but kept thinking it would miss reaching you.
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
Enclo.
