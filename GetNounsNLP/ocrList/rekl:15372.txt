[Letter]

April 18, 1926

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed are bids, and marble samples, for 

I - the linings and overflow gutters and borders of the San Simeon pools (not the Neptune Cascades).

II - the three pools of your University building.

Taking the figures together, resulted in obtaining very good bids on the work.

The reason I am providing samples again is that, of the three marbles you selected last fall, the "Portola" is off the market, as the owners found they could make more money from the quarry by grinding the marble up for chicken lime than they could make selling it for building purposes.

The "Pink Kasota" and "Yellow Kasota", the marble men will not guarantee against effloresence, at least for some years, except where entirely under water or entirely out.  Would you think this too much of a detriment?  The third selection, the imported green and white veined marble, curiously enough was under bid considerably by the Vermont Marble Company's figure using true Verde Antique, so I only included this bid on the list.

We did not originally figure on using marble for the small pools with their pavements at the University, or for heating and filtering the water of these two pools.  This has added, or will add, a total of about $16,000 to the work as a whole.

Everyone is delighted with the small pools.  The sun of the full south exposure is reflected from the semi-enclosing walls, making the pools very sheltered, and their height above the street gives them all the privacy needed, with a sort of piquancy given by the heavy traffic of the street below.

If you do not want to put in the expense of the marble, they will be lovely anyway.  You remember you said not to make "step daughters" of them.

We have kept duplicates of all the marble samples here.

Yours very truly,
April 15, 1926
