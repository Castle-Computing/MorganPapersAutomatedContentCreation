Dear Mr. Hearst:

As regards Mr. Doty, the nice school master at San Simeon - He has paid no rent since moving into the little house Mr. Rossi built for him as you directed.  What he expended for the school workshop naturally we did not know about.

His real trouble is political, San Simeon being in two factions - the stronger numerically being composed of the Lees, Summers and the ranch employees, one of whom, Bill Hopkins, was elected school trustee of the district and the trustee has the naming of the teacher.  Now Bill Hopkins is the man who was dismissed last spring from the Camp because, while an excellent workman, he was continually fomenting discontent among the other men.  Naturally, as the Rossis and Camp faction want Mr. Doty retained, he has practically assured Mr. Doty he will not be reappointed for the coming school year - hence Mr. Doty's distressed and not very enlightening letter to you.

Yours very truly,
