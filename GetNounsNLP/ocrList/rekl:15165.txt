February 5, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Trinkkeller was abroad when the fire screens were made and his shop, and no shop I could find could do better.  I ought they could be used in the less important places later, and will have Mr. Trinkkeller make finer ones.

Sincerely yours,



[Handwritten note on above Letter]
