Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday I had a treat seeing those magnificent new tapestries.  I am wondering if they are to go in the refectory.  I have ordered rollers for them as they are badly creased.  And the stained glass is this for the refectory also?

Is the set of choir stalls. (photographs enclosed) intended for the wainscot of the social room -- I find on measuring it up that it is too high for the tapestries.  Would you consider using your other set (enclosed)?  The originals in either case could not go far toward covering the space.  The ceiling of this room is G-R-E-A-T.

The two fine curtains received recently are for the arch between the Hall and refectory?  The could be enlarged with a plain border of velvet and lined.

We have been working on the refectory ceiling drawings for months and have roll after roll of little figures, etc.  A recent calculation as to how much longer it would take to finish them showed work for 214 uninterrupted days!!  When I said last summer we could get this ceiling up ready for the decorators, it was before the idea developed of putting all the little figures, and decorations generally, in relief (low).  In the long run this would probably be the most effective, best, and quickest, but it is evident that the ceiling could not be completed this summer except by putting a great many modelers on it, --- which has dangers given the character to be attained.
The above questions are "feelers" put out to know just what you want us to concentrate on for your use, and for effectiveness, this summer.

We are working ont he new rooms below C, Mr.Rossi on the hill, Mr.Van de Loo down here on the Lobby Ceiling, Mr.Lorenz on the bed room ceilings -- also on the "harem" bays for the towers.  There is a great deal of work on these bays in spite of the elements you sent.  they promise well.  The lower rooms House A will come next and those of House B last.

For the Main Building, finishing the concrete of the towers comes first, then the roof covering and tiles will be put on.  Mr.Suppo is making fine progress with the wood cornice carving and will finish all the carving this year -- I think perhaps by late fall, and it can be put up as it arrives on the hill, without waiting for the completed whole.

Inside the building, the main room elements can all be in place by summer except the wainscot.  The  refectory mantel, reja, balcony, stone arch and doors can be in, also walls plastered if you think best.

The ceiling and mantel can be up in the Hall -- (one mantel).

Floors are ordered for the refectory and Hall as agreed, travertine for the refectory, yellow and black marble for the Hall.

If you are coming out early we could rush up the pantry and use that for your kitchen this year, while we go on with the kitchen unit.

I will do my best to carry out any program you suggest.  We will have all the back bills 
paid up by the first of April.  I will have to be careful not to let Mr.Rossi run too heavy a rough labor camp, as the finish - such as the carving, marble floors, etc. have to run this season coincidentally,
Yours very truly,
JM-deM
