Dear Miss Morgan:

The report of the engineer on the Pat Garrity springs is somewhat discouraging but I do not think it is quite conclusive, because we only hope to get from the spring son Pat Garrity enough water to supply the requirements of the house, and we realize that any irrigation, and water for stock, would have to come from a dam or from wells, which by the way can be sunk in the proposed new ranch site.

Furthermore, this year is an atrociously dry year and general conditions cannot be judged by this year.

I should think we could count in an ordinary year on from ten to fifteen thousand gallons per day instead of eight thousand gallons per day; and with a little reservoir to help out in dry seasons I believe that would be sufficient for the house purposes.

Sincerely,
