Dear Miss Morgan:
	We are proceeding
with the terrace and getting 
along well. 
The sketches for the bridge 
[?] house are about done.
It's going to be sort of dull up 
here when we have [?]
plans to do.
You spoke of a moving picture
theater. I think that would
be fine. 
Suppose we make it a general 
entrainment hall. We could
have dances there as well. The 
seats need to not be fixed. I wish 
the billard tables could go there
too. Nobody wants to go awayover to the [?] at night.
	Perhaps we could make a two
story hall - billiard tables on one 
floors - moving pictures and dance
hall on the other. 
	Maybe that is too [?] Not a 
problem
To get away from architecture
We had a big event last night.
The dogs got a porcupine and 
the porcupine got them. It was
awful. Two of the dogs had stickers 
all over faces and in their mouths
and noses - also on their legs
and chest. It took us two
hours to get them out and it
wa bloody work.
	This morning one of the dogs
was still sick and we foundtwo more stickers hidden in 
him- on in his leg and one 
in his chest
The doctor x rayed him and 
got them out
Tonight all in peace, but I 
have declared a [?]
against porcupines. The 
reward is one dollar per head
until the beasts are exterminated
[?] neighborhood. 
Those poor dogs with a perfect
full [?] and of spikes were a 
shocking sight. 
They are pretty good perhaps. They 
stood all the pain without a 
whimper. I wouldn't have done 
it - and of course Marion wept all through the performance
We are afraid to let the dogs
out of our sight because 
they seem to be filled with 
ideas of revenge while they will
actually be filled with more 
stickers if the porcupines get
them. And there is always a 
chance of the [?] being
so bad that the dog have to be 
killed. 
Just was the porcupines 
are being killed. The first two
[?] have [?] been delivered
- two dollars worth 
I hope I will be called upon
to spend a hundred dollars this 
way 
Sincerely WR Hearst
That's all the news. Miss Julia Morgan
