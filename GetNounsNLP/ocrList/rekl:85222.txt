Dear Miss Morgan:

I believe a 30-foot wide room would be wide enough for the great hall.  I do not 
think anything less than that would be suitable for a room 150 feet long.

2.  I think in a 30-foot room the Sovereignceil could be used by moving the corbels 
of the escutcheon back against the wall and inserting another corbel or similar 
member between the escutcheon corbel and the beamed ceiling.

This member will only have to take up 5 feet on each side.

Of course in piecing out the length of the Sovereignceil we will use whatever 
ceiling we have which is suitable, but I hope we can use that Moorish ceiling with 
tiles; first, because it is so effective and second, because of the added height 
and third, because I am inclined to think that something radically different from 
Sovereignceil would be better than something not so different but still noticably
 different.

However, you will know best what to use out of the material on hand.

Will you please send a telegram to Byne telling him to send us the Cloister vaulting 
as well as all the other ceilings available in Alcantara, most of which I think we 
have already ordered, but certainly we will want and could use all of them.

3.  It seems to me that this whole Belgian mechanism for ringing the bells is 
unnecessarily complicated and could be simplified, and relieved of all its 
objectionable qualities by some first-class electrical engineers, such as the Edison 
Electric Light people employ.

Sincerely,
