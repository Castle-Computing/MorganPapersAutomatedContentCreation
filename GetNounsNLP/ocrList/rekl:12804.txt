Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:
OK Very good idea
1.
What would you think of moving the fire - places in the Royal Suite bedrooms over to be—
tween the windows, putting the beds between
entrance and bath room doors? It would seem to
offer several advantages and incidentally help
out in construction.
All right That will do very well
2.- I have been able to eliminate two of the
five steps up over the Royal Suite so far, but
am still trying another structural scheme in
hopes of getting another out.

5. The stone arch between the Refectory and
Breakfast room is carved both sides on all the
top stones, and on one side only of the imposts.
There is not room to put in the sliding door --
and the little doors, if the full 19'-4” of the
grille is used, will have almost no support to
the eye for the wall above -- unless, it just
occurs, we carry the choir stall as a paneling
across to the grille. -- Someway it does not
seem as fine.

What do you think?

Yours very truly,
Julia Morgan

You have drawn it 18 ft. Is that the size you want for the  [illegible]? That would be quite satisfactory to me. If you want still can grille [illegible] telegraph me WRH
What do you propose having in the matter of doors to cut out the Refectory from the Rear Entrance Hall? I think we must have sliding doors
