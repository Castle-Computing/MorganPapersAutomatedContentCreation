April 11, 1925.

Mr. Williaa Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
ﬂew York, new York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:
1.
places in the Royal Suite bedrooms over to be—
tween the windows, putting the beds between
entrance and bath room doors? It would seem to
offer several advantages and incidentally help
out in construction.

2.- I have been able to eliminate two of the
five steps up over the Royal Suite so far, but
am still trying another structural scheme in
hOpes of getting another out.

5. The stone arch between the Refectory and
Breakfast room is carved both sides on all the

top stones, and on one side only of the imposts.

There is not room to put in the sliding door --
and the little doors, if the full l9'~4” of the
grille is used,will have almost no support to
the eye for the wall above —- unless, it just
occurs, we carry the choir stall as a paneling
across to the grille. -- Someway it does not
seem as fine.

What do you think?

Yours very truly,

 

JM-deM
