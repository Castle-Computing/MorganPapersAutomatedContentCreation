Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday was another day like the stormy Sunday, colder, but not quite so wet.  
There is about 50 inches of water in the new reservoir (300,000 galls.) and more 
is coming in today, so it will prove useful even this year. The concrete work is 
entirely completed, some cleaning up only remaining to be done.

At the Animal Grottos, the forms will be ready for the concrete pour in a few days 
and the cement for this is on the boat.  The bathing pool and shelter for the white 
bears is going right ahead.  Do you want "grottos," their cages, etc. fully completed, 
or just made usable at this time.  Animal Hill work is continuing steadily.

Neptune and his companions from the Neptune Pool cascade are being moved for safety 
to the "cross axe" pool, and removing the marble lining of the small pool has begun.  
It doe snot look as though much marble could be saved.

This week has seen the bed rooms of the cloisters, etc., emptied of furniture and 
by another week, if the weather only settles, we can fall to on the roof developments.

The first shipment from Mountolive is all neatly warehoused here in San Francisco.

As always,

Yours very truly,
