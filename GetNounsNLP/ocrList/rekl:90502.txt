Dear Miss Morgan--

	There are a few things I would like to 
do in addition to what we are doing:

1.	Make bases and finish foundations on those
	four statues-- SPRING-SUMMER-AUTUM-WINTER-- that are on
	either side of the stairways on the plaza in front of 
	the big house. 

2.	I would like to put up the newly east standards
	for the railing all the way around the Hill, and provide
	bases where neccessary.
	
3.	I would like to extend the glass floor lights in the floor
	of the tennis court over the main pool. 
	
	I think we could light it in this way almost as well
	as the small indoor pool is lighted.
	
	Also we can resume discussion on where to put the 
	artificial lighting for the pool.
	
	I think a couple of rows of lights between beams
	on each side of this daylighting would be sufficiently effective.
	
	There is another thing I would like to do, and that is 
	set up the statuary which is here, -- not have it lying around
	in boxes. 
	
	Finaly, Mr. Loorz says there is a new coating for stone 
	and marble which protects it better that the English coating 
	we have. 
	
	If this is so, I would like to use it. The storms are
	very hard on the statuary as well as on the shrubbery.
	
	I guess that is all we can do at present, althogh I 
	woudl like to finish the wall down to the crossroads.
	
	It looks as if stocks were going up again, and there 
	was less danger of a catastrophe; so I suppose we can continue
	the work on the Hill. 
	
	I will ask Mr. Willicombe to supple you with funds for 
	May.
	
	Sincerely, 
	WR Hearst
