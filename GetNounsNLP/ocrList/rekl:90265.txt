Mr. William Randolph Hearst
La Cuesta Encantada San Simeon, Cal.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
We will have the light outlets controlled by the system of switches you outline. There are many wall outlets, all double, in each room. The Spanish lanterns do not hold many or large bulbs as a rule, without looking strange. How would you like some kind of a reflector such as used for Leusterweibchen at Wyntoon -- on switch for this, one for the lantern proper, one for the standards, and one for any mantel or special side lights?
Very truly yours,
JM:F
