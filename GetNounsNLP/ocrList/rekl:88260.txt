Monsieur C. Cassou
18 rue Morere
PARIS, XIV

Dear Monsieur Cassou:

	On receipt of your first letter, I did see
Mr. Hearst and was assured he would make immediate inquiry
and see that funds were forwarded. He asked me how much
was due you, but I did not know. Later his secretary
wrote me that a considerable fund had been sent, and that
it would be followed up.

	Mr. Hearst is not now in California, and
probably will not be here again this year, but I have
written to him, explaining your situation again, and hope
you will be enabled to continue to work.

	May I say personally that I regret greatly
all the inconvenience that lack of care as to funds here
has given you, but will explain that while Mr. Hearst's 
business proper is conducted in the most up-to-date and
business-like way, his personal affairs often are not, because
he has only one private secretary through whom all of 
his interests have to pass, often, as in your case, resulting
in long delays, sometimes loss of mail due to the fact
that he himself is continually on the move, and his secretary
moves with him.

	When talking with Mr. Hearst last, he asked
me if I had ever sent ou the revised plans of the pool with
the locations of the four groups still needed. I had not, 
as it did not seem that you would wish to make more studies
under the conditions. I mail them to you today in a separate
packet with a letter covering the facts.

	Your urchin is a constant reminder of you
and of the meeting with your delightful family to whom
please present my kindest regards. 

	Sincerely, 
	
	JM:F
