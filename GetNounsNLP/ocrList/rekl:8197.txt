Miss Julia Morgan, Architect,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, Cal.

Dear Miss Morgan:-

I enclose list of articles in the ninth carload shipment for Mr. Hearst.  Under separate cover I am sending catalogues of sales referred to in the list.  Some of the articles are purchases at private sale and there is no catalogue description for them.

Sincerely,
s/ L J OReilly
