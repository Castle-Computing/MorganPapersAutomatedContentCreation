Mr. William Randolph Hearst
La Cuesta Encantada
San Simeon, California 

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	Saturday we sent you such 
linens and chintzes as could be had in store
stocks -- and today, send a group selected in 
the manufacturers' agents' offices. I had to 
promise to return them all fairly soon. 

	I forgot to tell you that 
Sloane will reproduce the Social Room big davenport
for not to exceed $400.00 each, this including
the cost of putting on your covering. They 
will reproduce the chairs, including putting on
your covering, for not to exceed $100.00 each.

	Am also ashamed to have forgotten 
to have Miss Worn's layout and list, which
I will mail. 

	As always, 
	
	Yours truly, 
	
	JM:F
