Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,N
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

What would you think of using the same
"head motif" over doors and windows of the
sitting room of A, as is in the central ceil-
ing motif, with small statues, (originals
plus copies) over the pilasters? It might
be interesting-- am attaching sketches.

The columns for the lobby end of the room
are still in question. it seems to me rep-
licas of those under the big beam would be
the most satisfactory--but quite a piece of
work to do. The next best might be one of
the pairs of twisted columns. The red hang-
ings and valance behind the columns will be
quite splendid in themselves.

It has been a tug of war to got the
modelers to sieze the character of the queer
little musicians panels for the lower lobby
frieze, but they have accomplished it at last.
The ceiling with the shields is done, but the
“Hero” documents are evidently still in cus-
toms; so that ceiling is still to do. I en-
close a letter from Mrs. Byne concerning it.

I have used mirrors on the bath ﬂoors,
set out in deep mouldings to cover the deaf-
ening packs, as they were less expensive and
more sound proof than wooden panels. Have
also at last found a weather strip--deafening
strip--concern that knows its business. So
that woryy is over.

Am sending by Wells Fargo Express the
Swimming pool model. It is more delicate than
the others, but hope it arrives safely.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
