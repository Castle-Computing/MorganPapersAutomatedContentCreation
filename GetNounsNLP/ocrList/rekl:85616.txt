Dear Mr. Hearst:

This should have gone to you before.

There was a little delay in making sure of Mrs. Drew as she had all but actually 
signed a business contract she was much interested in, involving others.  This 
necessitated seeing her several times, and added to the impression that she is 
suitable.

She has had twenty years of good hotel experience, mainly in Colorado, - is a 
widow, the climate having brought her here on his account.  I found on inquiry that 
she handles servants well and is naturally kind.  I do not know how quick witted she
 is.

Mrs. O'Brien was more than satisfied with your provision of three months' salary 
from the first of October. She was in the midst of a general housecleaning when I 
told her, and wanted to finish, check linen, tidy vault, etc. before leaving, and it 
looked to me as though it was desirable that she do so.  She was to have left Saturday
 - the 8th.

Work is proceeding on the lines you set.  The West Terrace foundations in, the steel 
etc. on site, work on the Indoor Pool being pushed, etc.  The first rains have come 
and have freshened the perceptibly.

I hope you are quite well.

With kindest regards,

Yours truly,
