May 20, 1927.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

In regard to the Library-Lobby floor - I sent a couple of suggestions for a marble floor for this May seventh, as the slate one ordered for it goes above in the Gothic Suite Lobby.

If you did not think these good, how would a travertine floor with just Rosata marble inserts do?

The work on the paneling in the lobby will soon be done, and it would be fine to complete it.

Yours very truly,
