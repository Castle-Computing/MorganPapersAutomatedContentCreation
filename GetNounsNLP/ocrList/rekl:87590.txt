Office of William Randolph Hearst, La Cuesta Encantada, San Simeon, California

December 12, 1933.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Will you please instruct Mr. Loorz to put double windows on the bedrooms of the 
celestial suite as PROMPTLY as convenient?

At present not only does the water come in but the cold drafts make the rooms 
uncomfortable in spite of the heaters.

I think tight double windows will solve both problems.

In summer we can use screens.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco.
