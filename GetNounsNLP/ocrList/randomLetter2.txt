Dear Miss Morgan:

Work is almost suspended on the big house down here, and unless we proceed at a more rapid pace the house will not be ready by next summer.

We have spent a lot for installing the water piping and other matters of that kind but that will not do us any good unless we go ahead and get the rest of the house ready.

I laid out with Mr. Rossi the number of men that I thought he should carry in order to make adequate progress.  I will give him a check sufficient to enable him to carry that number of men above the present number, for thirty days -- and other checks at intervals of thirty days thereafter -- so these additional men will not come out of your regular appropriation.

Therefore, please allow him to have these men to proceed with some rapidity in completing the center house.  And there are one or two other things which I want done and for which I will make special appropriations.

One of them is laying walks by the stone men.  Another is relocating fences.  And the third is some alterations on the roads.

If, in addition, some of your bills are pressing, I can help you out with them.

I thought perhaps you might be down this Sunday and we could go into these matters; but next Sunday will probably do.

In the meanwhile Mr. Rossi can go ahead with eh check that I will give him.

2.  There is more work to be done at Wyntoon.  The house where the superintendent is to live is not big enough for him and his family.  They are rather nice people and accustomed to some comforts.  We will either have to build a n for him or enlarge the present one.  I think this should be attended to promptly, before winter sets in, which is early in that section.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
