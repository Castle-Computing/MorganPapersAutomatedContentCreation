Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed are samples and estimates from Kreiss & Co. made the seats now in "B".

Would it not be best to use these seats back in the Sitting Room of "A" as originally planned, as the velvet matches your old velvet wall hanging, and then get less expensive material for B, C, and lower A?

The enclosed samples of velvets are of a variety of prices, including a sample of the velvet used on the present couches.  I had no idea the yardage would run up so, when ordering originally, or would certainly have referred it to you.

I have had figures from other firms here on the new work, but at approximately the same price.  These people I feel a little more sure of putting in what is called for in way of the work at the Hacienda.

Yours sincerely,
