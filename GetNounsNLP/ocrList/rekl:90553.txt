Dear Mr.Hearst:

Enclosed are photographs of the four lapis colonettes used as your lamp standards.

You have out here only two Credenzas longer than the one now under the picture in 
House C sitting room.  Photograph of one I left with Mr.McClure, and enclosed is 
the photograph of the other.

Very truly yours,
