December 19, 1920.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Mrs. Hearst thinks she would like cream colored marble in the bathroom, and that she would like the bath itself covered with a gilt and polychrome wood settee.

She also wants the toilet covered similarly, and wants a toilet table in the same style.  Perhaps you could use the wall marble on the washstand.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
