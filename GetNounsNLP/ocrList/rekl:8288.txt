MAY I FIX UP THE LOWER SUITE A TEMPORARILY SO THAT IT WILL BE INTERESTING AND COMFORTABLE, USING OBJECTS INTENDED FOR MAIN BUILDING.  AM JUST RETURNING FROM SAN SIMEON.  WENT OVER WATER TROUBLE WITH DR, LAWSON AND THINK HE HAW REAL SOLUTION.  THERE IS MORE WATER FOR SPRING THAN LAST WEEK BUT NOT ENOUGH TO RUN MIXER.
