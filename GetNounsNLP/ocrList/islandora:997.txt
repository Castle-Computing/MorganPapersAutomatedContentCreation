MAP RECEIVED  MRS HEARST AND I THINK HOUSES TOO FAR DOWN HILL THE COURTS WERE NOT CONCEIVED FOR SUCH LOCATIONS AND NEW PLANS WOULD HAVE TO BE DEVISED WHICH IS INADVISABLE WE THINK OUR HOUSE SHOULD BE BROUGHT BACK FROM THE TEN HUNDRED AND NINETY TO THE TEN HUNDRED AND NINETY SEVEN FOOT LINE THE HOUSE OPPOSITE SHOULD GO BACK TO TEN HUNDRED NINETY SIX LINE THE MIDDLE HOUSE CAN REMAIN AS IT IS  IN OUR OPINION RAISING AND RETIRING HOUSES AS WE PROPOSE WOULD INCREASE
