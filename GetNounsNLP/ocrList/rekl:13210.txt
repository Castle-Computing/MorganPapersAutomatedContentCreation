Dear Miss Morgan:-
Am enclosing herewith your letter of October 30th, on which please note Mr. Hearst's memorandum.
Sincerely,
WillcombeOctober 30, 1932

Mr. William Randolph Hearst
137 Riverside Drive
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst: 

Yesterday I spent at San Simeon largely helping Mr. Keep improve his outlines and group the trees that fall below the regular planting. He has been busy blasting holes for all the next season's trees, as this seems to give the best start. The white wrappings were off the sequoias and they look quite like a grove. Since you left there has been a noticeable growth everywhere.

Mr. Rossi is on the 'big pour' which fills up to and over the roof before it halts. I never saw men working so very hard with so much of smiling good will as that polyglot crew of his. If a promised rains holds off, the pour will be finished in a week — otherwise proportionately later. Then we will have to get the next stage of main and stair towers up and poured before Christmas, in order to get the front part of the building dried out, so as to proceed to install the finish. The big ceiling of the social room is ready to go up as soon as feasible.

In general, I have had to concentrate on the main building at the expense of many smaller things but they are not forgotten at all (I mean concentrate expenditures.) 

I hope to send you the electric and water reports soon.

Yours very truly, 
Julia Morgan

Hearst handwriting: Many more Sequoias should be planted in those lower reaches and since the gigantea seem to do best better plant mostly gigantea.
