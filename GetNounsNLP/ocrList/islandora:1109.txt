My Dear Miss Morgan: The general appearance of the lobby enclosed is something like I would wish to have the entrance lobby of my small house. Of course we would have a little more Spanish treatment, but I mean a ceiling something of this character and generally white walls with the relief of the darker doors and some sort of ornamental feature at each end, with some simple furnishings. Sincerely,
W R Hearst
