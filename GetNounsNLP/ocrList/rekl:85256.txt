Mr. John Francis Neylan
Crocker First National Bank Building 
San Francisco, California

Dear Mr. Neylan:

	Thank you for your letter. I knew
about the proposed change of method and its
reversal - but as Mr. Braun still wanted the 
statements of indebtedness, thought other
arrangements yet were perhaps under 
consideration - and that the reason for carrying such
apparently old accounts would not be clear to
you without explanation.

	Thank you as always for your understanding
point of view. 

	Sincerely,
