Dear Mr H
File
Today I took the liberty of having rural type phones placed in pantry and Mrs. [illeg.]'s room with temporary wiring out to the Telegraph office dead switch [illeg.] as otherwise there would be no way of reaching the Hill except through Mr. Rossi's office phone. The phones are loaned so it will allow experiments as to the best solution. [illeg.]

I will [not?] come to Los Angeles this week, but will have some drawings along the lines of each of your suggestions ready by Saturday

my impression is that locating the indoor tennis court in front of the plunge would make the total mass of Bldg at this point too bulky for the location - I see no objection to omitting the [fore?] court, as its old reason for being does not now exist. Am wondering if the indoor court could take the place of house D - If space allows, would you think it good- Yours very t-
