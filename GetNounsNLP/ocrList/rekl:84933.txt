December 31, 1919.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have just received the location sketches
of the houses and am very much delighted with them. There are
two sketches, the one with the round tiled tops to the towers --
which we can call Sketch X -- and the other one with the pointed
tops to the towers-- which we can call Sketch Y.

I like the appearance of my little cottage in Sketch X
the better, where the gabled roof faces the bay; and this is
in accordance with,the plans, as I understand it.

In the other sketch-- called Y-- the roof slants
towards the bay and the gables are on the side. I do not like
this as much.

I suppose the details, however, of these cottages
are not meant to be exact but are simply to give an impression
with relation to their location.

I would judge that we have placed them almost
exactly right. They are certainly exceedingly pretty from
the point of view that the sketch is made from; and I think
they will be thoroughly satisfactory from the hill-top and from
the terrace of the main building.

The cottages are twelve feet below this terrace,
and will be sixteen or seventeen feet below the eye-line of
anyone standing on the terrace.

I think this is the very lowest point at which they
could be placed, and if they were lower they would entirely
lose all architectural effect from the hill-top. Indeed, as
I figure, the middle cottage -- C -- will not appear in the picture
from the terrace at all, unless merely a glimpse of the red
roof.

I think the cottages when decorated are going to be
very attractive and we will not be at all reluctant to have them
seen.

I suppose that the question of location being now settled,
the question of detail ornamentation should be taken
up.

I have thought a greet deal over whether to make
this whole group of buildings Baroc, in the Eighteenth Century
style, or Renaissance.

It is quite a problem. I started out with the Baroc
idea in mind, as nearly all the Spanish architecture in American
is of that character; and the plaster surfaces that we associate2.

all Spanish architecture in California with are a modification
of that style, as I understand it.

If we should decide on this style, I would at least
want to depart from the very crude and rude examples of it
that we have in our early California Spanish architecture.

The Mission at Santa Barbara is doubtless the highest
example of this California architecture, and yet it is very
bare and almost clumsy to my mind.

The best things that I have seen in this Spanish
Baroc are at the San Diego Exposition, and if this is to be
the style on which this group of buildings is to be built, I
would advise sending photographers and architectural draughts-
men down to the San Diego Exposition to get pictures and draw-
ings of exteriors and interiors and of details, so as to have
a lot of stuff at our disposal and for our guidance.

I understand that the San.Diego Exposition stuff
is largely reproductions from the best examples in Mexico and
South America, and that we could not go to a better source
to get the most agreeable specimens of this style.

This style at its best is sufficiently satisfactory,
though in our early California architecture it seems to me
too primitive, and in many of the examples I have seen in
Mexico so elaborate as to be objectionable.

Between these two extremes, however, there are good
examples and I think the San Diego Exposition affords the
best.

I would like you to see also, if you care to, a pic-
ture called SOLDIERS OF FORTUNE by Allan Dwan, Which is largely
taken at the San Diego Exposition and which gives some glimpses
of it, particularly the church building wide the tiled tower
and the blue tiled dome, which are very attractive.

The alternative is to build this group of buildings
in the Renaissance style of Southern Spain. We picked out
the towers of the Church of Ronda. I suppose they are Renais-
sance or else transitional, and they have some Gothic feeling;
but a Renaissance decoration, particularly that of the very
southern part of Spain, would harmonize well with them.

The Renaissance of Northern Spain seems to me very
hard, while the Renaissance of Southern Spain is much softer
and more graceful.

We get very beautiful decoration both for the central
building and for the cottages out of this Southern Spain
Renaissance style, and I think that would, in the main, be the
best period for interior decoration.

The trouble would be, I suppose, that it has no
historic association with California, or rather With the Span-
ish architecture in California.3.

I would very much like to have your views on what
we should do in regard to this group of buildings, what style
of architecture we should select. I think the Renaissance
decoration can be adapted to the smooth plaster surfaces.
I think it is so in the Church of Ronda and in certain cities
in the South or Spain and in the Balaeric Islands. They call
it pateresque. Do they not? I am not very sure about my
architecture.

I will telegraph Stanton to see what he can get in
the way of pictures and detains of tie San Diego Exposition;
and I have sent you many pictures, although you probably have
better in your library, of the things that appeal to me in
the Renaissance style.

In writing me your opinion, can you give me some
sketches to make the matter clear?

I am disposed to like the Renaissance the better,
and I think that you have indicated in the sketches that you
sent me, a disposition to adopt the Moorish cornice and the
tiled frieze, and a general Renaissance treatment. To my
mind the effect is very good indeed.

I think, too, the pointed towers are much better
than the rounded ones, and that if we wanted to get tiled
towers we should get much taller and more effective ones,
something like the ones shown in the moving picture I referred
you to, instead of coming so closely to the mission at
Santa Barbara.

I think the bells in the pointed towers are very
interesting and would be a noted feature of this architectural
group. But after all, would it not be better to do something
a little different than other people are doing out in Califor-
nia as long as we do not do anything incongruous?

Therefore, as you see, I am inclined to a pretty har-
monious Renaissance treatment all through for the main building
and the cottages as well; but as I said in my telegram, I
do not want you to do anything you do not like.

Now, as regards some things that I have an opportu-
nity to buy:

There is a big grill door that I mentioned in a
former note, about ten feet high. Would that be a good
thing either for the outer door to the main entrance or for
the inner door of the lobby entering into the assembly room?

And the window grills or rejas-- shall I buy these
three old ones/or would we better make our own and have them
just the size and style that we want? Is there anything
particular that you would like me to hunt for in old material?

JW Sincerely yours,
