Dear Mr. Hearst:

The stairs for the Celestial rooms which have been developed over the Gothic baths 
are formed now, ready for pouring, and work out quite well.  The only point which will 
require that you keep thin will be at the entrance from the top of the old stair tower 
- to this new hallway.

The Celestial bed rooms are developing slowly, looking prettier right along.

The Doge Suite bed rooms possess outer walls again, just poured, and the new chimneys 
and mantels are rebuilt.  There is much readjusting of ceilings, etc. yet to do.  The 
stone window of one bed room is set in place and is lovely.

The taking down work goes very slowly, dirty, tiresome work at best.  The new west 
tower is shaping up well.

The animal grotto took much time but is safely out of the way, and the new warehouse 
is all poured and being plastered, tiled, etc. -- up to schedule as to time and 
expenditure.

The weather is still very hot and the water situation trying -- a general condition, 
not just a Hill one.  The gardener has had some beautiful successes in both groupings 
and colors.  Miss Worn has been faithful and there has been a good spirit all summer.

With kindest regards,

Yours truly,
