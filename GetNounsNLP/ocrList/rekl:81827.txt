December 17, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The scaffolding is down in the Social Room and full force of carpenters working on 
the stall paneling.  The walls will not be dry enough to stain their final color, 
and will be too light -- this so you will not be unpleasantly surprised by the lack 
of color in them.  The work is good.

The rest of the "Hill report" went in a telegram this morning.

As always

Yours very truly,
