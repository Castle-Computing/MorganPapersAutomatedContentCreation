Dear Miss Morgan:

& Company. In fact I will not order anything we really do not need these

was afraid the cold had done much harm. Perhaps the coldest weather is
now over.

5. I shall have much pleasure in locating the two fine
oamelia trees. I

Where do you think they should go?

It seems from this distance that they might go on the
north and south side of the plaza in front of the big house.

4. We should keep Mr. Williams working on the
furniture.

heavily toward spring. .

6. I hardly think we can afford Mr. Adams this year.
Perhaps things will be better next year.

7. I would like to concentrate whatever work we do
