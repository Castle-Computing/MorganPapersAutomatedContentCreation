Mr. Hearst, #2.
June 17, 1929.

I will endeavor to meet your wishes as to how your funds shall be expanded -- but no 
matter how carefully budgeted, there seems always to be more to do and more bills to 
meet than the budget however large will quite cover.  Any suggestions will be 
cheerfully followed out.

There will be quite large payments due next month on another shipment of Roman pool 
mosaics, on the pergola columns, the balance on the warehouse fire protection 
installation, and for bills that will be due on the usual list, also will have to 
draw for our own account, unless funds come in from the old Santa Monica account.

Yours very truly,
June 17, 1929.
