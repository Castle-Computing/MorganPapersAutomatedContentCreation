Dear Mr. Hearst:

Right in the midst of the heavy revamping work, Mr. Macklen left, having secured a 
position in Los Angeles.  I tried to get him to see that it was only honorable to give 
the customary notice, but he said the condition of the new employment was based on 
going immediately into the new position -- he says at twice the pay and much less work.

I am afraid of the effect of the place in its present condition on a new man, and think
 that by putting in some extra time on the Hill with the men we have, we could get the 
 place shipshape by the time you arrive, and then you could instruct the new man as to 
 what you wanted in detail.  Meanwhile Mr. Slattery can be looking up someone, and I 
 will put lines out also.

Possibly Pete Sebastian could be called assistant gardener and be tried out.  He is no 
longer a boy, quite a capable young man, well liked by the other men, and with a native
 good taste.  Other perhaps assign certain work like (?) (?), etc. to different men.

There is a great deal to do yet on the tennis area -- the shovel having struck a ledge 
of real rock toward the esplanade -- however, all material is on hand for the concrete 
work, and it will go in very fast once the shovel is out.

Lots of pavements are laid, and lots of concrete has been poured -- although  you may 
not see it.  In any case, I think almost everyone has worked to the limit of his 
capacity.

Yours very truly,
