Miss Julia Morgan,
Merchants Exchange Blg.,
San Francisco, California.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I am ready to put the other housekeeper in whenever you get her, and I am also ready to
 get rid of Williams. He never knows what arrives and Heaven only knows what he does with 
 it.

I have complained about things that could not be found and that he failed to notify me 
of, and others have had the same experience.

Mrs. George Hearst was up at the ranch with the grandchildren and she bought  alot of 
stuff in Los Angeles for their Birthday.  She was inquiring for it and nobody knew 
anything about it.

So they had their Birthday without it, but by persistently inquiring they managed to find 
it five days after the Birthday, although it had arrived the day before the Birthday.  

It looks as though we should change people every once in a while, and we had so much success 
changing Rossi that I think we better change some more.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
