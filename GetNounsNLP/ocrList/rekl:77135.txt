Dear Miss Morgan:

I am very please that Slattery has found a good chicken man.  I think we ought to get our chicken department in good shape as soon as possible.

When I return from the East I am going to get rid of the dogs altogether, except perhaps a few greyhouds for coursing.  We will not need an expensive dog establishment.

I do want a large chicken establishment for practical purposes as well as for show purposes.  I think we should get an abundance of good big eggs from the Minorcas and other large egg layers, and that we should have plenty of spring chickens and plenty of capons.

In fact, I think the chicken ranch should so much more than supply the requirement of the Estate that a large number of chickens can be shipped for sale.

2.  I am very much distressed at the continued injury to animals along the road.  This is due to nothing buy rank carelessness and indifference and it will never be corrected by any mild measures.  I find Mr. Slattery not sufficiently incensed at these injuries and at this defiance of instructions, and I have written him a pretty vigorous letter on the matter.

I intend to hold him responsible for further injuries.  It seems to me that if he reported every few weeks that one of our fine cows had broken a leg or a neck, or that one of our good horses had been killed by a collision with an automobile, we would come to the conclusion that he was not a competent man for his job;  and I think we have the same right to come to that conclusion if he is incapable of devising and executing the necessary measures to prevent the slaughter of these rare and expensive animals on the Hill.

I have told Mr. Slattery what I think he should do.  He should have a lodge at the lower gate and a lodge at the upper gate.  These can be tent lodges until winter, and before that time we may be able to build permanent structures.

The second thing he should do is time the automobiles from lodge to lodge and also patrol the road.  A man can live at the little log house and have a small car-- a Ford or Chevrolet-- and give particular attention to the road at the time when the men are most likely to be rushing up and down.

The third thing to do is to be vigorous in punishment and in the elimination of men who are believed to be careless drivers.  It is not necessary to hold a court and establish by legal proceedings the built of this or that individual.  It is enough for us to come to the conclusion that certain men are not careful and that they are likely to injure the animals, even if they have not done so.

Miss Morgan--2.

Let us get rid of such men, and be reasonably quick about it.  I find Mr. Slattery a little too lax in this matter.

Reports have been made to him of men who are exceeding the speed limit, and he is doing nothing about it.  His disposition is to excuse infractions of discipline, and possibly to overlook actual causes of injury.

Mr. Slattery says in his report to me that the Emu lately injured and subsequently killed was hurt by some unknown person.

I have reports from two other sources that the person who injured the Emu was perfectly well known and that he is a protege of Mr. Slattery's.

If these reports are accurate, I do not like Mr. Slattery's attitude, and it may be necessary for us to get another man who is more of a disciplinarian, notwithstanding Mr. Slattery's other good qualities.

Sincerely,
