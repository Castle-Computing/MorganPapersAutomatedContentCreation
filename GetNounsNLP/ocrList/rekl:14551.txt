Dear Mr. Hearst:

I am bothering you once again as to the San Simeon finances, only because of not wanting to fall short of accomplishing the work outlined for this summer, if possible.

From the first of March on we are straight set.

But between December first and March first are short.

If this is as you wish and not due to misunderstandings at the Examiner office over this period, it is of course perfectly all right, and I will gladly re-budget as necessary.  Before spending our money which will come the first of April, I would like to know.

Your very truly,
