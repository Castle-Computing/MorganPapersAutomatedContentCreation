MR.WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST,
137 RIVERSIDE DRIVE
NEW YORK, N.Y.

OF THE THREE LOCATIONS THINK FINEST AND MOST LOGICAL WOULD BE THE PRESENT RANCH HOUSE AREA.  COULD DRIVE ACROSS BRIDGE INTO PICTURESQUE COURT YARD THE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS RADIATING OUT INTO THE FLAT AREAS.  IT WOULD CONTROL HILL ROAD AND CUT OUT LATER FRICTIONS OF DIVIDED MANAGEMENT.  IF WATER FROM ARROYO SECO DAM COULD BE BROUGHT OVER BY GRAVITY IT WOULD MAKE ANYTHING POSSIBLE CANNOT TELL AS ONLY SURVEYS GOVERNMENT ONES NOT SUFFICIENTLY DETAILED.  WOULD YOU LIKE ROUGH LEVELS TAKEN SO AS TO BE ABLE TO JUDGE SUPPLY?
