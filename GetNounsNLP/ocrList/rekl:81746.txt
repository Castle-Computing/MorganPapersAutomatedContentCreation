Dear Miss Morgan:

I have your letter about the marble hand rails for the pool at the ranch.

Those here are exceedingly satisfactory and as they are somewhat classical in design 
I think it would be wise to reproduce these exactly.  They are very practical, having 
good treads and good grips with which to pull oneself out of the pool, and they are 
also solid, not easily broken, and they are sufficiently good looking.

I am a little bit doubtful about combining these hand rails with lamp standards, unless
 you feel that this is necessary.  In the first place, the lamp standards would be a 
 little bit in the way.  In the second place, if the lamp standards were broken the 
 whole thing would have to be renewed.  In the third place, we might want to space the
  lamp standards a little bit differently when we come to the final lighting of the 
  pool.

I personally think it would be better to have the lamp standards separate.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
