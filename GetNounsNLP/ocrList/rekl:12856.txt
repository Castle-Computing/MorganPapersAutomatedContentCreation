Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Van der Loo has "set up" full size one section of the main frieze.  He will make four brackets, three soffits and three frieze panels, -- enough when put in place to give a good idea of the effect of the whole.

How much repetition of design do you think we should have?  Do you wish every bracket different or do you think one set of a dozen, repeated, for instance, would be enough?

The reason I ask is that if all are to be different we would make only four full size models with the variants at very small scale, for the carvers to use as guides.  If we are to repeat the models, Mr. Van der Loo would make whatever number you suggest as models and the blocking out would be done by machine from these.

Your telegram regarding the teak arrived today.  It is very fine stock, really beautiful material and has been in a warehouse for two years, having been brought over for the finish of a ship and not used.

You will receive in a few days a box of roof tile samples.  One is the same as is used on the little houses.  One is an extra heavy and extra large southern California product, -- and the third is a medium size tile of same pattern as on the small houses which can be made about half again as thick as the sample.  It is proposed to cement all the lower tile to the concrete roof and to wire the first rows at the edges in addition.  If all the tile were to be cemented and the contraction and expansion of the tile would cause them to separate from the mortar or to crack.  If you will select the size of tile the exact method of laying can be decided on later.

Yours very truly.
