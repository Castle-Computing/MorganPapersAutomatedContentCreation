Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.
Reached Sansimeon yesterday not having been able to get there on way south of road conditions. Found orchard planting well advanced. Garden much behind. Two upper bed room ceilings completed one lower bed room ceiling nearly completed lobby ceiling material ready to go up, fire places completed lower floor. Starting those in upper bed rooms. All outdoor work very much delayed.
