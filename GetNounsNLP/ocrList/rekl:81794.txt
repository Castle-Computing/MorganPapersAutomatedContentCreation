December 3, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your letter regarding the handrails is received and the handrails are ordered.

I will take up the fencing material and coyote proofing of it with Mr. Rossi and the 
others on the hill tomorrow.

I have picked out a collection of iron balconies and window grilles of about the 
dimensions you mention and am mailing you the book tonight. If you would care to 
just mail back the collection with the ones you select marked, they will be shipped 
promptly.

Yours very truly,
