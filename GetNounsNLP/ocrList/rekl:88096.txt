Dear Mr. Hearst:

I have been unable to get any goods exactly on the order of the Billiard Room sofa 
material.

I am sending you a few samples that may have possibilities.  If you will just kindly 
leave them, I will see that they are returned to the firm loaning them.

Very truly yours,

Samples sent express (Gilbert's)
