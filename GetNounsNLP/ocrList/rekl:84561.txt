BELIEVE INDOOR POOL CAN SON BE READY FOR FRESH WATER IF LADDERS PROMPTLY COMPLETED 
2 THE CROSS PIECES OF PERGOLA MUST BE LARGER THAN THOSE PREPARED FOR OUTDOOR POOL 
BUT I THINK WE HAVE NUMEROUS BEAM ENDS WITH BOTH ANIMALS AND HUMAN FACES WHICH ARE 
ON LARGE ENOUGH SCALE AND FROM WHICH CASTS CAN BE MADE I SUGGEST THIS BE DONE PROMPTLY 
AS POSSIBLE AS THE RAINS HAVE BEGUN AND WE WILL NOW ORDER PLANTS FOR PLANTING=
