Dear Miss Morgan:
I think this would be a good bench to put below "C" where the wall makes a corresponding curve.
(See large photograph marked -1-)
What I would like to know is how big should the figures be made to go there properly?
I imagine the figures in this photograph are almost life size of not quite so. Would we want ours any smaller?
2. I am sending you diagrams of another house. I do not think this house I am sending is very good and I have, in accordance with your telegram, ordered the Yorkshire stone Jaco-bean house, and asked Mr. McPeake in London to find other windows, doorframes, etc. for its embellishment. Sincerely, 
W R Hearst
