Dear Miss Morgan:-
I hereby transcribe some instructions I received from Mr. Hearst yesterday.:"
Dear Mr. Rossi: I am going to put in one elevator and one only. That will be in the North-West tower. Any body in the Doges suite who doesnt want to climbe to it on the East stair cases, can go up in the elevator to the library floor and walk along the corridors and down to the Doges suite. The one elevator will ser-ve the Library, the Gothic suites and the tower rooms I want to make a bed room of the room East of the study, the room where we are going to pit the ALABASTER MANTEL. We can make a bath room of one of the alco-ves and a closet of the other. Also please make immense closets of the space East of this bed room where I can store all kinds of clothes, per-sonal things etc. Run these closets clear through to the East wall and light them as the study is lighted from the top. (2) I will make bed rooms of the towers and restore the bath rooms on the roof which we tried once and then took down. The towers are higher now and will not appear dwarfed. Then we need the bed rooms in the big house for winter weather. It is a nuisance to go to the cottages through the rain. With this layout we will have twelve bedrooms in the main house. (3) The above planes are sufficiently sane, the following may not seem to be so, but please take them up with Miss Morgan. First i wonder when we build the new cottages E and F if we could build a tunnel passage connecting them with the cellar floor of the towers in one case and with the amusement wing in the other case so we can reach the main house in rainy weather. Second, i wonder if we could take down the towers of C and erect them much larger so that the bath rooms for the main floor would be big and fine and also that the upperv tower room would be very fine and large. Third, I have a plan for A but it is difficult to explain so I will talk to you about it. Finally we can put some sound proofing in the walls and ceilings of such houses as we build or rebuild. It keeps people in the bed rooms from being annoyed by the phonographs and radios and maniacs in the parlors. Otherwise I guess we are all right for a few days any how. W.R.H." "Please get copy of my telegrams to Miss Morgan in which I ask for several important impro-vements. Please help all possible to have these various things furni-shed as early as may be. Here are some other things which must posi-tively be done promptly (1_ You must get more power into the houses so we can have more heat and more light. The heating plan we have laid out but we mist also have light. We should have four standards in each of the four large rooms of A and at least two of these in each room should have a cluster of lights so as to give liberal illumination. We must have ample illumination in all the rooms of the little houses and the big house. They are as a rule underlighted. Also please stop coloring the bulbs. Use plain ground glass bulbs of high candle power. We can put on shades in some instances if needed. (2) We must make the doors and windows waterproof and draft proof. At present the water drives in everywhere and the wind blows in through cracks and crevices until the rugs flap on the floor. I want the doors and windows remade twice
