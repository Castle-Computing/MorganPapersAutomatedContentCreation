(Letterhead: Los Angeles Examiner, Office of the Publisher, Broadway at Eleventh St., Los Angeles)

August 27, 1927.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I do not think our gardening arrangement is very good.  Mr. Macklin is a good technical gardner but as you know has not much artistic conception, and Miss Worn I think hardly gives enough superintendence to the work to supply this lack.

I think you ought to reorganize.

Perhaps we can get a sort of landscape gardner as gardening superintendent and have him here all the time.

Then I think we ought to divide up the work among the subordinates, giving each one something definite to do, and holding each one responsible for his work, and giving him due credit for it.

Mrs. Hearst when she arrived felt the same way that I did about the pink geranium and lantan borders.  They have all gone to pieces, and they were under Webb so beautiful as always to excite comment from visitors.

Putting in the red geraniums is, I think, a mistake.  The color scheme is no longer attractive.

The pink geraniums were sufficiently vigorous under Webb, and the climate cannot have changed greatly since he left.

I would like to get a little more neatness in the garden without having rigidity.

You notice how beautiful some of the English gardens are.

The garden is now getting so big that it must have a sort of harmonious scheme.

I do not think we can advance much farther with the present arrangement.  I think we will have to do some of the things suggested above.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
