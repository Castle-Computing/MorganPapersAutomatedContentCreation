January 12, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

I am sorry about the chicken house superintendent from all points of view.  I have sent him my personal check for the month, for in spite of the effort to get a suitable man he was a personal mistake of judgment.  He had however done good construction work for Monterey County.

If you want to see the plans once more, I will be in Hollywood again Monday or Tuesday.

Sincerely yours,

s/ Julia Morgan

Please send my check to chicken house superintendent  The conditions are to blame not the man.  There is the urgent necessity of maintaining ranch conditions and rates of wages and harmony
