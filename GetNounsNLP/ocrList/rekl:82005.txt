Dear Miss Morgan:

We tried out the lights on the towers.  I hope you will take a look at them before you 
definitely decide; but I think the four corner lights outside the tower rooms, while we 
always intended to have the little lions with the columns, are failures.

Each one lights only one of the octagonal panels, leaving the intermediate panels dark.  
The effect is not good.

Moreover, it seems to me that the light shining from the rooms through the lacework of 
the windows would be more effective if there were no outside lights on this floor.

I think the eight lights above are extremely successful, and if we had eight lights 
above these again, where you spoke of putting the turtles, we would have the belfry
 and the lantern illuminated; and that would be sufficient.

That is to say, the crest of the towers would be illuminated; the rest of the towers
 would get only the soft light from the lights below on the plaza or on the library
  terrace.

We should put some figure, however, in place of the lions and lamps on the corners 
outside the tower bedrooms; and we have a little figure of a boy building an escutcheon
 which might be very good for that place.  We could have it duplicated.

I do not know that it is big enough, but I rather think it is, especially if it is
 put on a base.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
