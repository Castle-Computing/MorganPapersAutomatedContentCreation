[Letter]

April 4, 1923

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have your memorandum about the Chinese house, I do not think we will build this for some time.  I would like to build in the following order, the garage, the 
Moorish bathing house, and the Farm.  I suppose we can complete the construction of the big house and the garage before winter comes on again.  That will leave the Moorish house and the Farm for next summer. 1924.

It would be 1925, therefore, before we could get at the Chinese house or the English house or whatever we do after these first, necessary buildings.

I figure that the garage is quite essential and should, if possible, be built this year in addition to the big house.

The Moorish house is not so essential but it will be very delightful, as the bathing will be a large part of the pleasures of the Hill-top.  The Farm will be a great convenience.

And with all these things built we will have rather a complete community, and can take our time about further additions.

2. I bought a good deal of stuff at the Tolentino sale in San Francisco.  I suppose you know all about that.  At any rate Mr. Fairchild will give you full information.

There is one extremely handsome, elaborately carved Renaissance library table.  it is, however, pretty well wormeaten, and I wish we could get our furniture-mending man to treat it with his preparation for killing the worms, as soon as possible, in order to preserve it.

Also it must be packed and shipped with especial care or it is likely to crumble to pieces.  It is a handsome table, and was valued here at $7500.  I think we did pretty well to get it for $3500.

Another important object is the marble doorway.  I paid all that was worth, I think, but I wanted it very badly to go in the lobby of the big house opposite the entrance door, as the frame of this door leading toward the assembly room.  We can fill the top part of the arch with marble tracery of some kind, and use the bronze doors as entrance doors to the assembly room.

On the assembly room side we have the big wooden arch, polychromed, with the two mermaids.  With some additions to this inserted between the supports and the arch itself, we can make these two arches sufficiently similar in size.

I have explained this all to Mr. Joy;  I think he understands it.
I have been trying to get some good furnishings for the big house, so there is no use trying to place the things lately bought in the smaller houses.

I would like to have the furnishings in the smaller houses remain as Mrs. Hearst and I left them.  There is no use trying to make final arrangements until the big house is completed.  And the constant moving of furniture is not to its advantage.

I am sending out a lot of materials -- some Mr. Joy took -- and some I am sending by express to you direct.  Will you let me know if the materials that Mr. Joy took are available for the purposes intended.  If not, I would like to return them, as they cost some money.

I previously sent some other materials, largely yellows -- and one yellow damask with red figures.  This is quite a large set - sufficient for a room.  If you say so I will keep them -- if not I will return them.

Of the materials I am sending, one is a valance for the bed in my room.  This can e the bed I had planned for the room, and take the place of the purple material you do not like; or this valance, which is heavy and deep, could go on a rage bed which I bought at the Caruso sale -- which bed could then go in my room.  Perhaps the latter is better.  It makes less change of material and maybe provides a better bed to put so heavy a valance on.

The two rooms downstairs should have the two carved wood, gilt beds, and I am sending valances for them, much better than the ones they have.

They are all marked in the waterproof case in which they are being shipped.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
