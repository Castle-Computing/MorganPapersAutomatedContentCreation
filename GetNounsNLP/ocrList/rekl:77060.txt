March 8, 1928.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The ranch has a fine green look - the rain being of the soaking-in kind.  Mr. Joy has been back for some time following up garden bed layouts and working with Mr. Rossi on adjustments of the Neptune Pavilion to save all possible tree roots.

Mr. Rossi asks whether to have Mr. Macklen take out the material in the central plaza beds so as to trench out, preparatory to actually moving of the oak tree.  It will mean a very cut up effect through the spring and early summer months.

As to warehousing, a full day opening cases, leaves still about twenty five to open - mostly ornamental objects.  The photographs and fairly complete lists should have reached you Tuesday night.

Mr. Slattery has been worried about the lack of progress on the new chicken farm, etc. He made sufficient contour maps to show conditions and there are several alternate schemes to show you.  The sites are so good it seems too bad not to make the new work even if temporary, attractive.

There was plenty to keep one fully occupied, and I will gladly come back as soon as you want me there.

Sincerely yours,
