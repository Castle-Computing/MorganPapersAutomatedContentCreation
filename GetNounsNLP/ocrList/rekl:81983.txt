DearIMiss.Morganz

I think it would help to separate Rossi's expenses
into divisions. _ '

For instance, the kitchen, janitor, Rossi's office, are
more or less fixtures, and not directly construction workers. The
same thing applies to Mr. Williams and.his helpers, who should be
in this first division.

Mr. Rossi's incidental bills may be included in this,‘
and also the camp food supplies, the gas and oil, and auto repairs and
parts.

Another division.is the actual workers, such as teamsters,
laborers, carpenters and helpers, electricians and helpers, stone-
setters, tile-setters, plasterer and helper, painters, plumbers,
casterstone men, chimneymen, and treemen, the payrool at San Simeon
and poultry plant. In this division also could be included Mr. Rossi's
salary. -

p A third division comprises San Francisco payrolls, such
as mosaic workers, carving and modelling, marble work and workers, etc.

And a fourth division is purchases and supplies such as
lumber, plumbing supplies, electrical supplies, plain and ornamental tile
shipment, shipment of mosaic for Neptune plunge, and instalment of
warehouse fire system, etc. .

That makes roughly four divisions.

The reason for making these divisions is desirability of
clarifying the expenses in different directions and determining what the
essential expenses are towards progress on the Hill.

I have gotten Mr. Slattery's expenses down under $15,000.
I think I would like he add a few men on the actual Hill-payrool in
order to get in more workers. '

I am sure we could spend $13,000 on the actual Hill payroll,
possibly $15,000. We will keep the poultry plant and San Simeon pay-
rolls as they are, the warehouse payrolls as they are, and San FranciSco
payrolls as they are, because the men would be added to the Hill payroll
largely for mere concrete development. ’ _

Then with the Various supplies and purchases in one division,
I think we can proceed to clear up budget payments, such as the marble
work, the warehouse fire system, etc., and get them out of the way.

If you will let me know what we owe on these I will send you
the money to make the payments, and we will get On a basis of a little
quicker progress. ' ' Sincerely,
