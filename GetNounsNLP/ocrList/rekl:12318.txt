Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst 

Mailed under a separate cover are studies or Bath Alterations as requested.

House B could be altered by either dividing the present bath, or by the addition you suggest.  -- Are you not afraid that making the bath wing so large will hurt the scale of the house?

House c offer another problem on account of the Tower preventing a change of roof.  The divided bath, Type A or B, would be much the simplest solution.

The road turn is a difficult problem.  You would not consider having people descend in the "Grand Court" at the garage and come up on foot?  It is going to be very interesting.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM

P.S.  Your two " model farm" letters are just now received.  I am going down to San Simeon this week and will make the sketches on the spot with a sort of general diagram showing the location of the pecans, almonds, etc.
