need only be 12 or 14 ft high.  Thus there could be a terrace on top of these inside the green house overlooking the pool &c. reached by steps from the lobby

There would be steps down from the lobby (big broad ones) to the broad walk which would go south to the pool (20' broad) and across the pool by a bridge.  There would be a ten foot walk around the pool.  South of the pool the twenty foot walk would continue
to the suite of rooms at the south of the building.  Broad steps would go up to the lobby of this suite or to a big living room looking back into the pool and front on to the sea.  There could be a terrace above this suite as above the entrance lobby and dressing rooms or perhaps other rooms with balconies looking on to the pool &c.  That depend on how much (?) we use  The terrace probably best.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Having nothing to do on the train I made a stop at the green house an all glass house always looks terribly so I suggest that we build the house of concrete for at least one half the way up.  The rest can be green glass of the Tiffany type with gilt iron ribs &c. to hold it together

The front lobby and dressing rooms
