Dear Mr. Hearst:

We have had a long spell of very hot weather after the unexpected rains and the reserve 
reservoir made possible the pouring of concrete and enough watering of flower beds to 
make people if not fully content, at least grateful.  I have asked that 500,000 gallons 
be kept in reserve for real emergency use.

After the animal grottos were poured it became very evident that we needed to 
concentrate on he Main Building for a time in order to get even old cloister rooms 
back into use, - not so much getting new work up as getting old work out.

The Doges Suite bed room chimneys and mantels are moved and the new windows are being 
formed now in the walls, - cloister room chimneys and fireplaces are out and new walls 
built, ceilings involved are being patched, enlarged, etc.

I will not bother you with detail of which there is ample amount -- but just write that 
it looks as though the results will be worth the effort, and that this was the right 
time to make it. The windows are cut through to the new study balcony, - it is lovely 
up there.

With kindest regards,

Yours truly
