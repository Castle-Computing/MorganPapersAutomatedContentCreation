Mr. Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.
Dear Mr. Hearst:
Sunday was spent at San Simeon with Mr. McCoughern of the Board of Underwriters and their chief engineer. They advise very strongly, even with the present supply in sight, to install the new pipe from the reservoir of 6" and then 4" galvanized pipe rather than the 5", 3" and 2" proposed and to carry it [illegible] the esplanade with permanently located fire hose [illegible] [illegible] [illegible]. This will the two auxiliary [illegible] in the Main Building towers they think would give fullest protection to any possible [illegible] from outside or inside source. We have held up the order for the pipe until you pass judgement on this recommenda-tion.
The furniture is moved out of the small bed rooms of houses B and C, and walls, openings, etc. are being carefully covered so as to guard against damage while the new bath rooms are under way.
The plumbers are making good progress on the Main Building.
The water analysis shows that the trouble with your San Simeon water is that it is too pure -- equal about to distilled water. The salt of which is what it is eager and anxious to be otherwise, and gives up its oxygen free-ly to make [illegible] out of [illegible] illegible].They are [illegible] chem-ical deposits other than this in the filled up pipes. It is a great life, is it not? As a result it would look as [illegible] with galvanized pipe for the main lines and brass pipe for the water lines inside the Main Building, as good a solution as possible would be attained.
We have been having the usual September very hot spell on the Hill, while all is fog and wrecks on the shore. On the visit ten days ago, Mr. Keep proudly pre-sented the first ripe grapes -- this Mr. Greenbro tells me is a month ahead of the [illegible] pf the grapes down at the ranch house. This week there are lots of grapes. There are also three avocados nearly ripe on lower A terrace!

OK and [illegible] the pipe is big enough much bigger than usual.
[illegible]Mr. Hearst

The concrete beams and slabs are poured over the library and back to the line of the small bed rooms -- with prospect of getting the side walls poured up to the top of the galleries this week.  The steel beams for the storage floor are ready to be shipped to morrow, but it is doubtful if the boat will take them on account of the tides.  You will remember we had trouble with shipments last year after the Chile earthquakes.  The difficulty is not apparent to the eye as the surf is about as usual.

Yours very truly,
