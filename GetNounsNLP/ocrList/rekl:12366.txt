Dear Miss Morgan :

This seems to be a very satisfactory arrangement
for the top floor. (See No. l enclosed) ‘

2. I am returning the sketch for the proposed bathroom
addition to House B. I do not think it looks badly. In fact, I
think it looks well. The blank wall may need some relief, but
that we can easily give.

You might want to carry the balcony in front of the bed-
room, or do some such thing to relieve the spread of wall if you find
it too great. It is not too disagreeable to me; in fact I think
House B with the addition will be sore in the style of House A.

3. I do not see that we can do anything with House 0
except divide the bathroom that we now have into two with showers
instead of baths. - .

I do not like at all the lean-to roof that is shown
in this drawing. It looks like a makeshift-- an after thought.

The other plan.of extending the roof which comes along'
the middle of the tower would be better, but I think would look
awkward unless we also extended the tower; and with the tower
extended, it would be a bad and uninteresting shape—- would it not?
Also it would be a lot of work, which does not seem necessary.

The extension on.House B, however, could be done at some
paratively small cost, I should think. Please do not attempt either
of them just now. I am leaving for the West the latter part of
this week, and eXpect to be out there a month or so. These changes
could be made after I return here. ‘

Sincerely yours,
W R Hearst
