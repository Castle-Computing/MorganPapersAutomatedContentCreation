Dear Mr. Hearst:

A new possibility struck me Sunday for the bringing together of the refectory "scales." The ceiling evidently went in an unusually high room, else the boards back of the saints would have been more carefully worked.  How would it be, instead of bringing the scales of the ceiling down, to bring the mantels and stalls  up, but covering these large blank spaces around the figures with a semi Gothic diaper or painted decoration in the scale of the choir stalls, using the red and black of The Hall ceiling with old golds and blues added.

By tipping the mouldings we gained another inch or two, and someway or other I think the total of the changes has added to the decorative quality of the ceiling.  I hope it can be up and the room furnished again before you see it -- so as to get a clean cut impression.  My own eyes are not trustworthy - -possibly out of joint with hopefulness.

Yours very truly,
