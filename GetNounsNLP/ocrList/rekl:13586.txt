I HAVE PAID SO FAR FOR DRAFTING ALONE ON REFECTORY CEILING ABOUT TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS VANDERLOO SAYS IF WE REPEAT DESIGNS OF SIDES OF BEAMS TWO OR THREE TIMES MAKING ALL SOFFIT DIFFERENT IT WOULD SAVE MATERIALLY AND HIS WORK WOULD BE TWO THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THIS WOULD MEAN ABOUT SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS MORE ON DRAFTING AND I AM SENDING YOU SAMPLE OF DECORATIVE AND CEILING LAYOUT SO YOU CAN GET FROM HUNRICH COST OF THE COLOR WORK.  HE WOULD HAVE NO DESIGNING OR DRAWING TO DO ONLY COLORING.  KEYSTONES YOU SENT ARE CHARMING BUT HAVE NOT SUCCEEDED WITH GRAINED CEILING DESIGN SUFFICIENTLY SATISFACTORY TO SEND YOU.
