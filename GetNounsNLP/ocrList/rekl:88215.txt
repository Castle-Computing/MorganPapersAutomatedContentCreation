Dear Miss Morgan:

	I have your letter of February 4th.
	I am doubtful about the pergola. I
would think perhaps caryatide or perhaps tall posts more or
less plain in new art manner. 

	The lights should throw down on the 
nearest court-- not across the yard as now. Perhaps there
should be an elbow, thus:

court

	The posts should be higher than at
present. The wall, too, should be two or three feet higher, 
eliminating the wire mesh.

	It would be well if we could have a
row of posts in the middle of the yard between the courts,
but this will probably be difficult and possibly undesirable as
they would interpose obstacles.

	I think we can get along with the outer
posts and with strong lights. The elbow could hold two
lights or three. 

	Sincerely,
	WR Hearst
