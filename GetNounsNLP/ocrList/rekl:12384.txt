Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Here are various Model Farm sketches.

From the point of view of decorative effect--the site above the "Oaks on the Road Bend" appeals most.

The site in the hollow where the quarry is, is the unanimous choice of all the practical people as having shelter in the winter, water, space, proximity, etc.

The orchard hill site has the advantage of space and keeping all farm activities to the rear of any traveled road.

As to the fence on Old Spring Hill, -- It is sometimes hard to tell in matters as personal as on the Hill, when to exercise spot judgment, and when to hold for instructions-- In this case, troubles developed in running the fences just after you sailed for England.  The contours and ditches are such that the eight foot fence meant nothing at all to the deer because of the almost continuous jumping over points--Mr. Kincaid who took charge of the running of it, went over the line and reported that the fence would be practically useless even if very much heightened, and advised going around the brush.  There are no other deviations that I know of.

All the fences will have to be carefully heightened at various points where there are possible jumping advantages.  The deer are so tame this year you can see them in the day time on the "meadows" and they are determined to sample the orchards ahead of you.
I have sent word to holed actual planting of all kinds until your arrival.-- There has been nothing. (or practically nothing ) ordered for planting not on your lists.

the latest gardener looks to be hopeful.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
