Dear Miss Morgan:

Your letter of February 2 was delayed in the mails and only arrived to-day.  I have already answered most of the questions it brings up.  I think the side elevation is very interesting as you have drawn it.

There is only one small change that I would suggest and that is that those lower windows of the lower hall be made higher, be made square, and be covered with a permanent, strong decorative and protective grill.

The next paragraph relates to the front elevation.  For this front elevation I prefer the windows with the colonettes, as I think the front can stand that additional decoration.

This would apply probably to the windows opening on the court also, and possibly to those windows in the same bedrooms which open on the side.

On the rear elevation, however I much prefer the windows without the colonettes in the middle, making single windows with a pair of sashes, for two reasons; first, because there is fully enough decoration on this rear elevation as it is and second, because these are the view windows and should have as little interference as possible with the view.

The third paragraph refers to the balustrade.  I like it very much as it is drawn in  the general drawing of the rear and side elevation. It think it is better there than in the detail drawing. It contains some cartouches and figures of a Renaissance character that are decorative.

I do not think it is necessary to reproduce the balustrade of the big, main  building in these little buildings.  As a matter of fact, I think the big main building will have a rather earlier appearance architecturally.  

You are going to use the Gothic or transitional gateway with those Moorish doors in the main building, and you are going to use the Gothic virgin above it; and the towers have those pointed decorative features which are at least early Renaissance.

I thought of using those big, carved, animal-figure beams around the cornice; and this is early in its effect.

The small bungalows are not quite in this style and I should think you would want a different balustrade, therefore, on the big house, a more Gothic one in fact, some thing like the open work over the door or something like the balustrade on the high towers.

Your fourth paragraph refers to the rear elevation

of the bungalow, and I agree with you it is very stunning.

The long streamers seem a little bit heavy for the proportins of the building, but maybe they are not.  I would omit the steamers but I thought they might be made a little narrower.

However, you are the best judge of that and I will leave the matter in your hands.

The next paragraph refers to the tile.

I have sent some tiles as motifs.  I think without producing them exactly they will offer suggestions to you.

I like the irridescent tile particularly, and I think when you draw it and have it made, you should draw it to have it fit the requirements of the bungalows.

I thought the escutcheons could be used not conspicuously but occasionally, as for instance in the center of each panel.

Finally, regarding the stair from the lobby to the lower room, I agree with you it encroaches on the lobby and also makes the lower room too much of an open room.

I should be inclined to omit this stair unless you find when you come to drawing details of it that it has decorative advantages and that the above named disadvantages can be overcome.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
