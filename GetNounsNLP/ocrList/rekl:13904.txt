Dear Miss Morgan:

Enclosed please find check for $5,000 for Byne, in place of the one previously given for this purpose which was destroyed in fire.

2.  I think we ought to get some specialist on farm buildings when we get to laying out the ranch houses and the farm houses.  I think it needs a peculiar kind of experience, and in order to get these things right it would be best to have someone who has had that experience as a consulting expert.  See enclosed clipping of advertisement in COUNTRY LIFE of Cross & Roberts, Inc., Boston, Mass.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
