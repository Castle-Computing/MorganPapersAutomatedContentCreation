Dear Mr. Hearst:

The raising and placing of the structural steel for the new Gothic Study space floor 
over the twin's room was accomplished last week, and the concrete roof is all off the
 main part of the study and the walls almost ready to receive the new trusses.  
 The Gothic Baths and stairways over them are stripped and we go onto finishing these 
 right away.

We found a marble I think you will like for the Gothic baths, but am only putting in 
the new basin slabs of it.  It is obviously impossible to put marble in the eight or 
ten new baths at this time so I am plastering all baths in such a way that the marble
 can be put in later without disturbing the plaster.

Monday there was an immense rainbow over the Casa Grande, followed by sharp showers. 
No harm done, but a great relief felt when they ended.

Yours very truly,
