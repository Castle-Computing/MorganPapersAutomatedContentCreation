Grand Hotel -- ROME


August 21, 1936.

Dear Miss Morgan:


	One thing that San Simeon really needs is 

fountains. I mean fountains which FOUNT. 

	

	The new Neptune fountain should have a torrent of water
	
	
	There should be a spouting fountain in the middle of the 

great north terrace in addition to the two night and day 

fountains on each side.

	

	We should and of course will have the big Diana fountain

below -- but with lots of water. 


	On the west terrace we should have a large spouting 

fountain in the middle -- or else two on the sides. 

	

	On the south side we will have to wait until the terraces
are built there. But we should consider fountains in connection
with these terraces. 

	After seeing the Villa Deste again I realize what water
would do for San Simeon. It would double its beauty and charm. 

	In the midst of ta dry land we would have an oasis of 
beautiful fountainds. 

	The work must be done ona grand scale, and there must be
not merely statuary and basins but WATER -- spouting, tumbling
water. 

	All that is needed are reservoirs of sufficient size -- and
pumps. 

	I think the best way would be to build reservoirs on
Reservoir Hill. Let the fountainds be run by gravity, and then 
pump the water back to the reserviors on the hill. 

	Enclosed are some photographs of Tivoli. Maybe they
will affect you as they did me.

	We would not have the giagantic effect of the waterfall, 
but we could have some splendid water effects -- small and LARGE. 

	We could have a great fountain in the space north of the 
inside pool. We could also clear Menagerie Hill and have a
formal lake there, with urns and railings, and a fountain in the
middle, and a formal garden. -2-

	This lake could be the lower reservoir, from which the
water would be pumped back to the mountain. 

Sincerely.
