Dear Mr. Hearst:

How would Chinese forms, color and detail do for the Animal Hill development?  
It would allow of using the motifs you liked in "Illustration", and gay little roofs 
in the green setting would not be a petering out of the massive architecture of the 
main group, but be obviously a pleasure garden as seen from the esplanades, etc.

We purchased directly from China recently lovely tile roofing and can pick up locally 
at this time some really beautiful decorative architectural terra cotta pieces, all 
very reasonably.  The lotus pool idea planned for the other Hill, could be used, - 
the maze, etc.  We could make Mary Ann a wonderful residence at quite small expense.

Yours very truly,
