Dear Miss Morgan:-

Replying to your letter of December 3rd regarding the double sequoia gigantes and other trees he bought at Niles, Mr Hearst said ---
"Hoped to use these in so-called rose garden to give architectural effects in the landscape gardening.  The will be big enough to be noted at any distance."

Sincerely
s/J Willicombe
