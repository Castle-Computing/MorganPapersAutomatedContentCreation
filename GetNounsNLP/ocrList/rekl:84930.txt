Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Los Angeles Examiner,
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr . Hearst:

The Customs appraisers would like to know
if you have any photographs, description or other matter
relating to the 17th Century ceilings from Munich. They
have no idea of what the ceilings are like, and no one
wants to have the ceilings unpacked and set together and
repacked, if avoidable. The officials are perfectly friendly.

As always,

Yours very truly,

JM-M
