Dear Mr. Hearst:

The full complement of men (75), plus the additional twenty men you authorized, are at work on the Hill, and in addition, Charley Hadley, our original pavement and tile man will be on the Hill Monday and the material for his work is there, or will be.  John Van der Loo, with a good crew, is casting a balustrade to go back of the Egyptian Statue motif.

The Plaza Major is a sight, but I don't see how it will be possible to get enough material to pave it without jeopardizing the program on the other work.

The pool and dressing rooms will surely be ready for the Fourth of July, but it can be done only by losing no points in the program.

Do you see the little tables in the pool dressing rooms, of wood, prettily painted, or of iron with marble slab tops?

As always,

Yours truly,
