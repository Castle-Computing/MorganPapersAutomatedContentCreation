Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Riverside Drive,
New York  City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst :

Thank you for the telegram of the 18th on receipt of the revised plan of House "C".  I am desperately at work getting out the revised working plans for Houses "B" and "C".

As telegraphed tonight, I am lengthening the view bed rooms in House "B" and have at last an elevation which seems to be satisfactory, giving the enclosed floor.  The small disconnected balconys seem necessarily so in order to make the stairway work out effectively in elevation.

There has been a great deal of difficulty with the foundations of House "A".  The roots of the California cherry and other growths have so eaten into and disintegrated the rock that the slightest tain causes it to shave off just as it did on the road.  Twice Mr. Washburn has thought he had arrived at a good foundation only to have the rock scale off again.  This has been serious, only that it has taken time.  It has been far more easy to get carpenters than laborers to go down from the city and all the available local laborers have been used from the geginning.

As to floor tile; enclosed is a design in shape copied from a panel in catalogue A. The firm making the outside floor tile is wiling to make these in soft tones of red but with considerable color variation. I have seen floors of this pattern in the Spanish Pyrennes which are very lovely.

In rearranging House "C" it was not possible to get a good roof line and at the same time cover the little court porch with the main roof.  It can be covered with a flat roof, edged with tile, or left an open pergola.  I would like to leave it the latter until you see it, as the flat roof could be put on just the same. It will make the court some longer, and also give three different court treatments.

Have the columns for the courts been shipped yet?  I have been pushing the modeling to get as many moulds as possible ready to ship on the steamer that leaves here the 26th, - a bird in the bush,- as the next chance to ship is as yet very uncertain.  I am asking Mr. Minott to use all means

Dear Mr. Hearst:
Thank you for the telegram of the 18th on receipt of the revised plan of house "C". I am desperately at work getting out the revised working plans for Houses "B" and "C".

There has been a great deal of difficulty with the foundations of House "A". The roots of the California cherry and other growths have eaten into and disintergrated the rock that the slightest tain causes it to shave off just as it did on the road. Twice Mr. Washburn has thought he had arrived at a good foundation only to have the rock scale off again. This had been serious only that it has taken time. It has been far more easy to get carpenters than laborers to go down from the city and all the available local laborers have been been used from the geginning.
As to floor tile; enclosed is a design in shape copied from a panel in catalogue A. The firm making the outside floor tile is willing to make these in soft tones of red but with considerable color variation. I have seen floors of this pattern in the Spanish Pyrennes which were very lovely.
In rearranging House "C" it was not possible to get a good roof line and at the same time cover the little court porch with the main roof.

Have the columns for the courts been shipped yet? I have been pushing the modeling to get as many moulds as possible ready to ship on the steamer that leaves here the 26th, a bird in the bush, as the next chance to ship is as yet very uncertainegr I am asking Mr. Minott to use all means
to get it for us around the middle of April. The materials will be shipped up raw, also the mounds, and all casting will be done up there.  It was only the possible chance of "arriving" with it.

Yours very truly,

Enc.
