Dear Miss Morgan:

I think we can arrange hereafter to have $30,000 a month appropriated for the
 Hill work.

2.  If you will let me know what large payments are due next month, that is for 
the month of July, on Roman pool Mosaic, the warehouse, fire protection, etcetera, 
I will meet those seperately.

3.  I understand you are not satisfied with the pergola.  What is the matter with 
it?  Is it too high for the width or not wide enough for the heighth?  Shall we fit 
the columns that are erected with the top beams before we finally make a decision?

4.  I will send you a check tomorrow for the old Santa Monica account and will learn 
in the meanwhile exactly what the amount is.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
