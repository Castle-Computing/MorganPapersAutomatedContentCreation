Dear Mr. Hearst:

As telegraphed today, the Ruiz Ceiling proved to be twins.  On unpacking the center portion here in San Francisco to get the length, I thought the different colored panels alternated, not dreaming of more than one ceiling.

They came form rooms about 17 feet wide by 50 to 55 feet long.  I am using the less rich one because it is more easily extended at sides and ends, and has quite a Christian Gothic note in the little paintings, whereas the second ceiling is purely Moorish.

We have so far received twenty-three choir stall backs and some ten seats.  We are making the door trim on the Social room side and will have that completed by June.  Just how much more is possible will depend on the arrival of all the available stalls.  It is evidently too late to get the room completed.  Shall I dismantel the room - take out the marble doorways and put up the stalls as far as possible - or wait till all the material is assembled?  Otherwise the Hall and Refectory, Vestibule and Doges Suite look possible.  My fingers itch to do things like the pantries and library and patio, etc.  I do not divert to as we are running well over budget.

The scale of the patio cloister stones is much larger than expected.

As to road-work and pool, the wet banks have somewhat delayed both.  I spent some hours going over the toad and banks with Mr. Tudor in charge of the roadwork, as he was expecting to leave the space on the upper side between the new road and the planting in too rough and torn up shape for Mr. Keep to handle even with a quite large force.  He grasped the need and I will go back the end of the week and help with the lines again.

The Choisys and roses and outlook were simply wonderful in the moonlight -- I staid over the two days on account of the ceiling difficulty and enjoyed the late evening wandering around.  Wished you could have had the pleasure.

Yours very truly,
