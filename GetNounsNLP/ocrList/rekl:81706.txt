November 6, 1928.  

Dear Mr. Hearst:

1.	I am sorry about the pool heating incident.  My instructions to Mr. Rossi, who has 
always had the pool in charge, were to keep one plumber and one electrician on the Hill 
day and night, in case of emergency, when you or your guests are on the Hill.

Any instructions as to filling the pool, heating it, etc. have always been give to Mr. 
Rankin or his men by Mr. Rossi and were, I find given as usual in this case, but were 
to stop operating.  Also, I find that Ridgwell, one of Mr. Rankin's men, was on the
 Hill and available.

There has been no change -- Just before you came Mr. Rossi brought up the matter of
 providing employment for Eubanks at Mr. Parks request and suggested using him on 
 the pool, elevator, etc.  I told him I thought if such a position was formed it should
  be filled by a man of more experience and mechanical ability as a Jack of all trades 
  would soon ruin the fine equipment.

2.	On receipt of your telegram as to gardeners, I asked Mr. Slattery to put young 
Sebastian in charge temporarily of the upper garden and Heaton from the Esplanade 
down, as neither could handle the work as a whole.  Nothing was said to either of 
being responsible beyond doing their best in the emergency.  I agree with you in not 
liking the new hours either in camp or garden.

There are conditions which I would like to take up with you before a new set up.  
I would have last week, but thought we might carry on, if closing at Thanksgiving.

Yours very truly
