MR. WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST,
137 RIVERSIDE DRIVE, NEW YORK, NEW YORK.

THINK YOU ARE UNDOUBTEDLY CORRECT ABOUT MAIN BUILDING SCALE BUT DON'T YOU BELIEVE SWIMMING POOL BUILDING WILL ROUND OUT ADEQUATELY THE SUPPORTING MASS.  THE GROUP OTHERWISE FROM A DISTANCE THINK YOU WILL APPROVE.  APPLICATION OF DETAIL PROBABLY WILL OVERCOME PRESENT OVERSIZED EFFECT FROM ESPLANADE.  WILL STUDY OUT LARGER SCALE APPROACHES ETC.  WILL FORWARD STUDIES FOR CEILING OF NEW LOWER BED ROOMS HELD HER EXPECTING TO GO OVER WITH YOU THESE HOLIDAYS.

JULIA MORGAN.
