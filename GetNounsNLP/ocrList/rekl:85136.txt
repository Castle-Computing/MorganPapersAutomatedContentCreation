March 24th, 1932

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Thank you for the very kind letter.

Probably the banners take the place of the stained glass in color and interest -- 
and the blue sky even at night allows one's spirit to stray way beyond the boundaries 
of the room.  The closing in of the walls probably would not be felt in the Gothic 
Study, where there would be much clear glass in proportion to the colored and 
decorative inserts - and banners would not be featured.

Enclosed are the two Gothic doorways we decided on two weeks ago for the doors of 
the Billiard Room to Theatre and to Duplex Stair.  We asked Mr. McGregor to send these 
on the next opportunity.

The Romanesque mantel is perfect in design for the Celestial sun room.  I hesitated 
to suggest it on account of its apparent size given given the possible chimney height.  
As we really do not know its dimensions I have written Chris asking him to provide 
them.

I am sorry we  are so slow, but the place grows larger and larger and in comparison 
the workers are less and less able to make any startling impression.

As always,

Yours truly,
