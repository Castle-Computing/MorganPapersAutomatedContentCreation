My dear Miss Morgan:--
	
	I write this note on the "Chief" returning
from one of my numerous brief and utterly senseless trips to
the Coast. I was in hope that I should see you at San
Simeon, but on the way there when I got as far as Santa Maria 
a telephone message from my secretary told me that Mr. Hearst had
come down to Los Angeles. He is on the train at present,
with a number of friends preparing to go to Spain on the 26th.

	His three oldest boys and their wives go with
him so that he will have agreeable company.

	I am writing to tell you what great pleasure
it gave me to learn from Colonel Willicombe of the great 
improvement in your health. You must live a great many years to do
useful work, and to set before men and women an example of integrity
and purpose, which is unfortunately completely lost upon them.

	Take care of your health, do not fly too
much and TRY to drink Guinnesses stout, mixed with White Rock
or some very light beer. This will make you grow stouter and put 
good blood in your veins.

	I hope I shall see you on my next trip out,
if there is a next. I have not left my house for a long time,
because my wife has been extremely ill, ever since our second
boy Hugo died very suddenly of a blood clot last June. She bore
up courageously at first, but as I feared could not stand the shock
and until the last few weeks has been desperately ill for almost a year with three nurses taking care of her.

	Now I am happy to say that she is much better and
able to enjoy her children again. 

	Women have all the hard part of this life, because
they really feel. 

	Take good care of yourself, rest a great deal, 
take stout, and read Voltaire's "Philosophical Dictionary". Sincerely,
and being almost seventy years old, I can add
	Affectionately yours,
	A. Brisbane
