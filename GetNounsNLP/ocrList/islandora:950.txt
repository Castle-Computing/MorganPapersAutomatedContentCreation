destroyed. It looks unusually bare in that section I think they are putting too much fill behind the new wall between lower C and lower A. If they go as high as they appear to be going they will bury the toyon and cherry bushes just inside the wall. It looks as if they were trying to get rid of that great hump of fill south of the [C?] curved stairs without taking it outside the walls where it belongs and where we have no dump cart to take it. I shall stop the dumping there. If by any chance it is being done by your orders let me know, but I am sure it will kill the shrubs. They are partly buried already. 
The coping boxing on top of the wall is held together by cleats across the top. These, being smeared with concrete stop, look like part of the wall and look so well - give such an interesting character to the wall I can't help suggesting such a treatment for all the surrounding wall. Terrible suggestion? Sorry.
