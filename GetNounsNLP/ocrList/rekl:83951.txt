NIGHT LETTER COLLECT JUNE 9 1930.
Julia Morgan, Merchants Exchange Bdg., San Francisco, Calif.
Just received sketches. I think I understand plan perfectly and like it very much.
First, I understand new tower first floor can be reached going up ew stairs from music room and down new stairs from cloister, either way out of rain.
Second, new tower second floor can be reached from cloister gallery and naturally elevator can be used.
Third, there is moreover communication between new tower first floor and new tower second floor by means of new staircase.
Fourth, Revised bedroom of twins and new bedroom are also fine.
Fifth, present Doges bedroom should have plenty of windows on patio. stop Only one window is shown. stop There might be more. Sixth, elevation looks lovely. The whole thing is I think tremendous improvement. Thanks.
Seventh, I have bought another beautiful window, rectangular, eight feet long and seven feet high. stop It might do as window for new Doges bedroom. Am mailing photograph.
