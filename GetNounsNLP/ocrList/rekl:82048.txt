COPY OF MEMORANDUM FROM MR. HEARST
FOR MR. ROSSI AND MR. JOY


The fireplace and chimney people seem to have left the fireplaces in good practicable 
shape, but the reconstruction of many of them in size and shape leaves very undecorative 
spots.

I would like to talk to you and Mr. Joy about the best way to cover these spaces and 
make the fireplaces look more finished.

Also I do not think the iron supports of the brick work are sufficiently strong to do 
their proper duty.

2.  The lowest row of lights on the north tower should be taken down.  That would eave 
the north tower with a row of lights below the tiling and a row of lights at the crest
of the cupola.

The lights that are taken down from this tower could be put on the library balconies.

The south tower is all right, as it is, but the lighting should be completed all the 
way around.  In fact this should be done with both towers wherever we have rows of 
lights.

This will give us an opportunity to see the effect from a distance as well as nearby.

I think it would also be a good idea to light the tower rooms from the inside so that 
the light can filter through the stone grills in the windows.

This will help us to tell what outside lighting effect harmonizes best with this inside 
lighting.
