Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst instructs me to ask you kindly to dispense with the services of Mr. Slattery 
at the Ranch.

Told Ms Clark

2.  Mr. Hearst instructs that his activities be disposed of as follows:

Turn the horses and that department over to Mr. Parks, also the maintenance of the field 
animals to Mr. Parks, also the orchard and forestry work.

The shop expenses, including gas and car repairs etcetera, are to be placed under the
 supervision of Mr. Rossi, also the maintenance of roads already built. under Mr. Rossi.

3.  In a letter that Mr. Hearst has sent to Mr. Slattery, before making the decision 
to dispense with his services, Mr. Hearst fixed the amounts to be expended for these
 different activities as follows:

		Orchard, forestry, etc.........			$1,000.
		Maintenance of field
		animals (pay-roll $500.
			    (feed, etc.500.......	 	 	  1,000.
		Maintenance of horses, etc...	    	     500.
		Shop expenses including
		gas and car repairs, etc..........	    	     400.
		Maintenance of roads already built,	     600.

				Total				$3,500.

As stated the first three items will be under Mr. Parks and the last two under Mr. 
Rossi.

Enclosed is a memorandum of some of the things Mr. Hearst instructed me to tell Mr. 
Slattery in the letter above referred to and which will be useful for the guidance of 
the people who will take care of this work hereafter.
Miss Morgan - page 2

Do you wish me to communicate these instructions of Mr. Hearst's to Mr. Parks and Mr. 
Rossi, or will you take care of it?

4.  I had a talk with Mrs. O'Brien today and her household budget has been arranged as 
follows:

		Housekeeper.........	          	          $175.
		Butler........				200.
		Butler's assistant........		100.
		Chef..........				250.
		Assistant chef.....			125.
		Richard.............			135.
		1 Maid............			100.
		2 Filipino helpers at $100.each...	200.
		Jan, the house man...........		125.
		Ray, the truck man........		125.
		Mooney, (watchman)..........	150.

					Total	       $1,685.


Added to this $1,685 will be the commissary for the household, $25., within which Mrs. 
O'Brien says she can easily keep it and include the laundry; also the light and power 
$600. and fuel oil $100., making a grand total for the household of $2,635.

Mrs. O'Brien has promised to try to reduce this figure.

The garden activity will be kept to $2,500., of which $1,500. is for wages and $1,000. 
for supplies.

For the Hill Top, therefore - household, wages and commissary, also garden wages and 
supplies will make a grand total of $5,135.

It should be explained in connection with the household commissary that this is to take
 care of the first seven people on the above list.  Mr. Hearst instructs that the others 
 shall eat at the construction camp.

Undoubtedly Mr. Hearst will want to place Mr. Baldwin, chief gateman, on this household
 list. I presume Mr. Baldwin will be sufficient.Miss Morgan - page 3.

Mr. Hearst has notified Mr. O'Brien that the figures given above must be adhered to 
when he is not at the Ranch or whenever only an occasional guest is going up.  When 
the expenses go up due to his being at the Ranch or having guests there, he will expect
 it to be kept within reasonable bounds, - say $6,000.   at the outset for commissary, 
 - and will pay with his personal check for any excess.

I am sending this letter to your office in San Francisco and will give you a copy when 
I see you Wednesday.

5.  Mr. Hearst thinks the garden activity can still be cut down somewhat form the $2,500.
 allowance for wages and salary.  In fact, he would like the Hill expenses that are on 
 his personal account cut down to $5,000. altogether.

Sincerely,

s/ J Willicombe
You will recall that Mr. Hearst wants the white deer put in with the buffalo and the 
animals that do not take much feeding.  Also you will remember his instructions regarding 
the use of the white deer for venison in order to keep their numbers within bounds.

Mr. Hearst instructed you to dispense with the vegetable garden and also with Gillespi's 
road building activity, cutting out those two items entirely which you estimated in the 
neighborhood of $4,000.  Also he instructed that the poultry activity be turned over to
 Mr. Parks.

Also Mr. Hearst instructed that the services of Ray Mills the chauffeur for the hill car
 shall be disposed with.

You will recall that Mr. Hearst wants to get rid of the animal activity on the hill, - 
that is the carnivorous animals, - but you will recall that he has instructed Mr. Baldwin 
to send the tiger, the black panther, the cheetahs and Jerry to Mr. McIntosh at the San
Antonio Light.  Also Mr. Hearst instructed that you sell four lion cubs.

Please remind Baldwin to let me know when he is ready to ship the animals to San Antonio 
so that I may notify Mr. McIntosh.

That will leave on the hill the grizzly and other bears that Mr. Hearst wants to keep, 
the little elephant Marianne, the two chimpanzees and other monks, and the native lions
 that Mr. Hearst said he wanted to keep unless he decides later to the contrary.

Mr. Hearst is agreeable to your dispersing the funds, - outside of the household, - at 
variance to the budget arrangement, but only with the understanding that the total of 
the budget shall not be exceeded.

Finally it is Mr. Hearst's instruction that any other expense such as the road repair 
that you called to his attention shall be submitted and authorized specifically.  Your 
careful cooperation will be appreciated.
