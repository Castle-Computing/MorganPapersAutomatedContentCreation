Mr. W.R. Hearst
c/o Los Angeles Examiner
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	I wish you would use me in any way that
would relieve your mind as to the care of your
belongings. There never has been nor will there be,
any charge in this connections, an honor and pleasure.

	The Wyntoon houses are ready now to step 
into - need just putting out of linen and putting in 
of supplies. The local care this winter was excellent. 

	As explained, the one unsightly spot up 
there is the "Tea House", as the material to finish
with is piles on the terraces. The "Bridge House"
is not unsightly - just looks under construction, 
and the "Chalet" can look finished - with little more
work. 

	As always
