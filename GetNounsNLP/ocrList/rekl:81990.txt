Dear Mr. Hearst:

Miss Worn feels she made a mistake in suggesting the begonias for all the inner 
esplanade border, realizing that quite a bit of it toward the southwest corner is in 
full sun.  I enclose her note.  Nothing has been done and no suggestions made to the 
gardener.

Yours very truly,
