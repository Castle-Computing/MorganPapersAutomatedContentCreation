Dear Mr. Hearst:

I cabled Mr. Byne in regard to finding a ceiling for the refectory on receipt of your letter.  I had started Mr. Van der Loo on the plaster forms for the Chiaramonte ceiling on receipt of your letter approving in a way Mr. Humrich√ïs sample beam.  I saw this in place on Monday, and agree that the color is helpful.  The texture given by the canvas was a disappointment, and I am afraid that no matter how much the painting is antiqued, the effect will be unnatural.

Your mentioning the Hotel Biltmore work made me think of another possibility.  The decorators who did this work were those who did the New York State Building decoration at the 1915 Exposition, only they are much more skillful now, due to the years of experience since. They invited me down to see the work while in process and took me all over the scaffolds, etc.  They are used to working very quickly directly on the plaster in another kind of medium than used by Mr. Humrich.  If you do not find a suitable ceiling would you consider getting a bid from them on this ceiling work as a piece of work by itself?  The designs to go on all the beams, panels, etc. are completely drawn out full size, and only the actual painting need enter into the cost.

Yours very truly,
