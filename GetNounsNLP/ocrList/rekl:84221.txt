Dear Mr. Hearst:

The balcony is fine, but sketching it in, it looks too delicate in detail for 
the wood brackets it comes in contact with, and seems out of character with the 
very Spanish cornice detail.  It might be used as balcony for the middle one of 
the three windows on the theatre wing on axe of the stair way- although this might
 be "gilding the lily". It seems too good not to use, but is also unusually 
 definitely of Renaissance Italian than the rest of the stone work.

Have you received Mr. Byne's monastery photographs?  A partial set and a letter 
saying he had sent drawings and photographs to you, were received here today.

Yours very truly,
