Dear Miss Morgan,
Te way I figure we have ample space in the big assembly room.
We have 24 ft for each tower = 48 ft 
We can make the refectory 28 ft wide which will make the outside 34 ft. 46 + 34 = 82 in all
Deduct 8 ft for the recesses 82 - 8 = 74
Then tale the two tapestries 24 ft each 48 ft 
Deduct that from 74. 74 - 48 = 26
Therefore 26 ft is the space available for fireplace and doors.
The fire place is 16 ft 26-16 = 10
That is 16 ft for fireplace and 5 ft for each door
That seems about right to me. Another suggestion on other side 
WRH
(over)Just a suggestion 
It has some real advantages
Big doors on trophy room side to close against [illeg.] when desirable to shut off the room from refectory maybe?
No upper balcony looking in refectory. Tower leads directly into upstairs parlor with perhaps small side [illeg.] with wooden grills. This gives the big iron grill a better chance being [illeg.] up against the wall.

Room 20 x 40 or 22 x 48 or 24 x 48 Small Towers to match forward small towers balancing those spaces. Big lighting window double grills opposite refectory arch. Fireplaces at each end. Doors on one side of fireplaces into passages on other side into open air 24 x 48 would give ample room for upstairs parlor and bedrooms 
loggia could be built but like a balcony or curved up from ground [illeg.] [illeg.] in room below for the double windows.
