September 14, 1937.

Mr. T.J. White, 
959 - 8th. Ave.,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. White:

	I find that Mr. Hearst never recieved proper
credit on the Piedmont books at the time the Hilltop
buildings were taken over by Piedmont for the built-on
antiques, such as ceilings, walls, fireplaces, etc.

	The registry of antiques which Miss Morgan 
recently sent you included these built-in antiques but
they were not designated as such.

	Do you not think it advisable to authorize
Miss Morgan to prepare a list of these built-in antiques, 
with values, so that Mr. Hearst will recieve proper credit
on Hearst Suncial Land & Packing Corporation books. 

Very sincerely, 

William W. Murray
