Dear Mr. McClure:

While finishing tennis court we might alter the esplanade walls so as to make the tree 
boxes as planned and then move the various trees to their positions.

This would clear the space for the new great hall and leave us in readiness to begin 
that construction whenever we wish to.  Otherwise when we decide to build it will take 
us six months to get ready.

First build up the walls to the top of the present wire netting.   

Second Add the extra lamps and strengthen the supports as planned 

Third make much larger tree box on West and move one of big oaks there

Fourth finish walls smoothly and paint dark green like court.
