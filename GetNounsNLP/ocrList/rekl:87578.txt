November 4, 1933

Dear Mr. Hearst:

We have notice that a German ceiling is due here in a few days with a collect charge of 
$169.90 payable to Hoyt, Shepston & Sciaroni, against it; also a bill of lading of 
$31.53, total $201.43 needed.

Shall this be warehoused with the other Wyntoon material in the Haslett warehouse?  
It is the least expensive in warehouse charge, also in drayage and handling.

Yours very truly,
