Dear Miss Morgan,

I think the attached letter from Mr. Young might be interesting to you, although I do not suppose it reveals anything new to you.

Still, I thought I would send it along in case we should have a salt problem in connection with the concrete construction of the ocean bathhouse.

Sincerely yours,

Dear Mr. Hearst:

It runs in my memory that some engineer claimed that the San Marcos reinforced concrete building in Santa Barbara collapsed because there was a high percentage of salt in the mixture.

If this is true, and it sounds plausible, it seems to me that California's building regulations should be made very strict as regards both the sand and cement used in all building operations.

This, in turn, brings up the question of a large volume of competition which our California cement producers have to face (I think the cement used in the Chamber of Commerce building next door was imported from Germany).

What do you think of getting Miss Morgan's view of this matter, and, if my hunch is correct, start a campaign to insist that all cement imported over seas be in water tight containers to eliminate the possibility of salt infiltration, and further, that the sand used in the construction be tested for its salt content?  Thoughtless builders may scoop up sand from the sea which contains a high percentage of salinity.

Young
