Dear Miss Morgan:

In comparing our place here with the Italian villas
I find that the main advantage the Italian Villas have over
us are in the matter of wide terraces.

Our walks and terraces are generally narrow and
not formal, the Esplanade being the one notable exception.
We have practically no large terrace areas in the nature of
plazas except the one in front of the main house. Of course
we will have another at the east end of the main house when
we construct the patio, but I think the whole grounds would
assume a more formal and finished aspect if we transformed our
walks into formal Esplanades and paved them with tiles and
bordered them more or less rigidly with vases or railings
or statuary, etc.

The two terraces on either side of the pool and the
flights of steps leading down are going to be attractive
features. I suggest we make these terraces as big as possible
and the steps as wide and stately as possible.

All these things on a big scale will help to conform
the landscape to the scale of the main house and in addition
they will make the grounds much more livable as well as much
more stately.

I would like to go over the grounds with you to see
where these esplanades and terraces can be made. .I think the
pomegranate walk should be widened to about the width of our
present esplanade and I think another esplanade should be insert-
ed in the landscape, possibly by widening the present walk
which goes partly around the hill and joins up with the terraces
in front of the houses.

I think there should be some very wide terraces below
the present wall on the west and south sides particularly. The
road rather prevents anything of that kind on the north side.
However, effective terraces can be put in front of the new
north house, which we can call House D or Casa del Canyon for
identification.

The wide terraces below the present wall can be
approached b very imposing flights of steps on the order of
the steps below the pool. Particularly can features of this
kind be built in front of Houses A and C, and probably in front
of House B, which will be the new house on the south side.JM-2

I should think two such lower esplanades and terraces
could be built before we come to the final lower wall, which
we have vaguely planned, and which would be an esplanade
covered with a wide pergola bearing grape vines.

I think there should be fountains and various
features such as columns and statuary to emphasize the
important points on the new terraces and stairways, and
that there should be temples and towers and pools at various
viewpoints and pleasant places.

I don't see why we canâ€™t build something conspicuous
and useful and attractive too in the middle of the blank
space to the meet that we always feel needs filling up. I mean
the space west of the pool in the middle of that stretch of lower
wall.

Perhaps we might have a temple here, or an Alhambra
tower, or a Moorish pavillon, or Chinese tea garden, or some-
thing that would be effective and enjoyable.

I would also suggest that we put columns or some
feature on each side of the cascade terminating the esplanade
where it turns and goes up back of the Neptune fountain.

We can walk over the grounds and plan out these
things. I am merely making these notes as reminders.

Sincerely yours,

The money that we would send on this road I would
prefer spending on a dam. Mr. Rossi has selected a dam site
at the foot of the ravine and I am asking him to have the
necessary tests of the flat bottom made, to be sure that we
can build a dam there, and also to have the specifications
made and estimates of the cost accurately made.

Apparently we can build a forty foot dam for about
$50,000, or he cost of the road which we have decided not to
build

This dam would hold plenty of water for irrigation
and should make a very pretty lake and fish pond. It would
solve Mr. Parks' water problem and to a certain extent
relieve the drain on the Hill's water supply.

If our road building crews get through their road work
by the latter part of September, they should be able to build
the dam and have it completed before the first of the year.
perhaps the crew that has worked on menagerie hill could be
transferred to Chinese hill and take off the top of that
hill, and in a way make way for our ambitious plans for the
salt water pool.

This is perhaps the finest site any where around
here and the question of how best to take advantage of it
in the matter of construction is quite important.

I have various vague plans which I would like to
discuss with you. Mr. Hunter has sent you a number of
pictures and suggestions for various features. I am merely
trying to lay out here the general plan for the fall and
winter work.

Sincerely yours,
