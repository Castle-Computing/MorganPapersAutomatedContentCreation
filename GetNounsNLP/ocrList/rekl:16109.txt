Dear Miss Morgan:

I have asked Mr. Neylan to let you have $150,000 to clear up the University memorial and you can proceed to clear it up promptly, but I hope it will not run over that amount.

2.  I have asked Mr. Neylan to let you have $38,000 to $40,000 a month for the ranch account for the next three months.  This should enable you to proceed at good speed and to clear up all pending bills.

After December I want to reduce expenses materially.  There is so much rain in January, February and March that it is hardly worth while spending money trying to do anything.  Of course we can do some work inside the house, but very little outside.

I hope, therefore, that the north wing of the patio can be poured in October, November and December, and that the temple court and pool and fountain, etc., can be finished in that time.  Perhaps you will also be able to make the new lower esplanade and lay out the garden beds for spring planting. We can begin work again some time in April.

3.  I have left word for the road men to stop when they have completed the road from the upper gate down to the ranch house.  Rossi thinks that will be about the ninth.  It may be desirable, however, to have the road makers continue on for a couple of weeks or possibly to the end of October, and build the road from the upper gate to the cross roads, and fix the banks along that south side so Keep can plant the jacaranda.

Therefore, I think I will do this if I can scrape up the money.

4.  There is a lot of second-hand pipe to be bought in Los Angeles.  It is good pipe and has been dipped in asphalt.  It can be had for 70 cents a foot-- 8-inch inside measurement; 5 3/8 inch pipe can be had for 36 cents a foot, similarly dipped, etc.  New pipe can be had through Judge Gary at wholesale rates, which are much less than we pay.  I mention this in case we need any more pipe.

5.  I have learned some things about flowers, and find the hydrangea are very much like roses.  They need a little rest period, and the pruning must be very carefully done and at the right time.  The trouble with our hydrangea is that they were pruned too severely and probably at the wrong time.

In addition to the hydrangea bushes, there is a hydrangea vine

which is said to be very beautiful.  I think we should get some.

There was a dahlia show in Los Angeles, with very wonderful dahlias exhibited, much finer than any we have.  I wish you would have the gardner get the best dahlias, canna lillies and gladiola.  These are standard flowers, almost as useful as the roses.

By the way, there is a tree called "The Rose of Sharon."  I understand it is very pretty.  There is also a dahlia tree with flowers like single dahlias--very pretty; there is also a so-called coral tree.  I think we should have these trees in considerable number.

I am informed that certain kinds of lillies bloom at certain times of the year, so by planting properly, one can have different varieties, to be sure; but we can always have some kind blooming and available for cutting.

I also find there are perennial asters, somewhat different from the annuals, but nevertheless a pretty flower.  In fact I find out a lot of things that our gardner does not know.  I hope we succeed eventually in finding a better gardner.

6.  We must have screens for the fireplaces.  I wish you would send me some designs for these screens.  If we do not have good screens we will have a great many holes burned in our flooring and in our rugs.  Please note the disastrous effect of fire on the teak flooring in front of the big fireplace in the assembly room.

Sincerely,
