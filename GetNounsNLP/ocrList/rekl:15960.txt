Dear Mr. Hearst:

Regards the warehouses --

Before ordering finally the two metal warehouses for San Simeon I added two large ventilated windows to each building so as to be able to lay our ceilings, etc. with the doors closed if necessary.  This made the total for the two building erected $13,710.00.  Concrete floors and piers to be provided for them by you.

Yours very truly,
