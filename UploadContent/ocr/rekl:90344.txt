Dear Miss Morgan : 

	Miss Davies and I have been discussing the 
windows at the east end of the study. 

	Miss Davies thinks that they let in too much of a 
glare of light, and that the yellow tone of glass minimizing 
the glare would not be very attractive. 

	She advises stained glass for the windows. I am inclined 
to favor the stained glass. 

	We have so much stained glass that probably we could 
adapt some of it to these windows to make it set perfectly; 
and if we could not, we could fill out with a limited amount 
of modern stuff. 

	In fact we could make the whole window modern-- but I 
do not think it would be necessary. 

	This would exclude the view, but the view on that 
side is not the prettiest one,-— certainly not now with the 
animal cages down on the hill. 

	This view would be improved if we put the lake there, 
but it is a view we could get by opening some of the stained 
glass windows. 

	I think this suggestion is worth considering. 
	
	The great curtains-- which seems the-only curtain solution 
of the situation,-- would be a very large scale matter, 
and while it would be all right at night when drawn, if drawn in 
the daytime, it would practically exclude all light,—- unless 
we made it of diaphanous material. 

	At any rate the choice lies between the great curtains 
covering all the windows when drawn, or stained glass windows 
which would shut out the view, but which would certainly give a very 
beautiful effect in the day from the moment you come through the 
entrance door. As stated I am inclined to favor the latter. 
Please let me have your views. 

Sincerely, W R HEARST
