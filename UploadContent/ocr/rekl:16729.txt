Dear Miss Morgan:

Please do not think I am altogether mad, but Mr. Swinnerton suggests something which may be worth while considering.  On the other hand it may not be possible or desirable.

He suggests that between the towers of the third floor of the north wing we have a studio for artists.

We would have a wonderful north light and ample space for the kind of thing that an artist wants.

If we cannot put the studio here we ought to try to work it in somewhere, because we will have artists here in the future as we have had them in the past and it would be a good thing to have a place that was peculiarly well fitted for them to work in.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
