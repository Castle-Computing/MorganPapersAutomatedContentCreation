Dear Mr. Tunell:

In reply to your inquiry of the 14th regarding the account of Carlo Freter 
for statuary, would say that Mr. Hearst handed us a check for $1400.00 for 
the balance of this account and we forwarded same to Carlo Freter on February 
18th, 1931.  We have a receipted voucher from Mr. Freter bearing date of March 
6th, 1931.

Yours very truly,
