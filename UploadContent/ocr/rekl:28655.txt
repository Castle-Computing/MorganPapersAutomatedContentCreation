Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Hearst wants locks put on the bookcases in library of big house at ranch.  To do this, I understand from Rossi it will be necessary to put doors on the bookcases.  Therefore, Mr. Hearst instructs me to ask you kindly to have doors put on, made of this criss-cross wire, 'in the regular Italian style,' with Yale locks so that the books will be secure.

Sincerely,

s/ J Willicombe

P-S Chief asks that nothing be done with duck pond until he gets to ranch; I believe there is some question as to whether the duckies shall or shall not have cement.
