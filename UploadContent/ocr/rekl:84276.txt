Dear Miss Morgan:

Here are some choir stalls submitted by Mr. Byne,

I do not understand the opening paragraph of his letter.  Not long ago he offered me 
a fine set of Gothic choir stalls and also a set of later stalls, which were either 
16th or 17th Century, with large figures in low relief carved on them, figures of 
Saints I imagine.  I accepted both of those sets of choir stalls and I imagine they 
have been bought and shipped, but his letter arouses in my mind the apprehension 
that I may not have secured them.

2.  The stalls Mr. Byne submits now are moderately interesting.  What do you think 
of them?

I would also like to know how we stand on previous choir stall purchases.  Can you 
inquire?

3.  I am enclosing also photograph of the road and ferry that Mr. Byne is using in 
the transportation of our castle.

I cannot, however, send him $50,000 in March.  I have sent him $25,000.  He purposes 
applying this to previous purchases, for fear the price of the Paseta will increase. 
 It has steadily decreased.  However, I will guarantee him against any loss from the 
 possible increase in the price of the Paseta, so he can use the $25,000 sent him for 
 his castle requirements, and I will send him further funds as often as I conveniently 
 can.

Sincerely yours,
