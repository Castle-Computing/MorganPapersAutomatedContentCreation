Dear Miss Morgan:

I am very serious about eliminating electric heat everywhere-- Wyntoon, San Simeon, 
and Santa Monica.

It is unpleasant, unhealthful, dangerous and expensive.  It scorches anything near it. 
 It often fails when it is most needed.  It is difficult to regulate, and the most 
 costly of all methods.

All that can be said in its favor is that it is easy to turn on, but no easier than 
steam.

I suggest that we put steam heat EVERYWHERE.

Of course we plan that at Wyntoon.  We can easily install it at Santa Monica, and we 
can do it this summer when we are putting on a new roof, reconstructing our porch, and 
fortifying our foundations.

Installing steam heat seems the least of our worries there.

San Simeon is something of a problem, but steam there will be a great comfort.  It 
seems simple enough for the ground floor.  We could put it under the two great windows 
in the assembly room, and put it where we have the electric heating in the east room.

I doubt if we need it in the refectory, but we might put it for insurance at the east 
and where the stone Madonnas are.

Steam in the library would be pleasant and easy to install under windows.

The upper floors offer some complications, but can doubtless be worked out.  The 
advantage would be tremendous.

We must positively have the simplest and most accurate form of regulation.  I 
understand some of the recent thermostats are practically perfect, and even some of 
the regulators on the individual coils are accurate.

I suppose we might have both, but this may not be necessary.

The flat shapes of the coils makes it possible to conceal them entirely behind beautiful 
grilles, so we are all set as regards both utility and decoration, if we can work out 
the most practicable method.

2.  At San Simeon I would like to put in the bowling alley.  I would like also to finish 
the hand ball court.  These will make good winter games.

I think we should also perfect the lighting over the indoor pool and we should finish
 the tennis court and perfect the accessories there.

I wonder if concrete pillars would not be better than iron or bronze for supporting 
the lights and awnings?

If powerfully reinforced they might be extremely strong as well as decorative.

What do you think?

Our night lighting system on the tennis courts is not ideal.  Actual overhead lighting
 is best, but must be high.

Can we work out something of that kind, or shall we increase the lighting at the 
sides.

With the tennis court finished, we would look more spick-and-span on the Hill.

Sincerely yours,
