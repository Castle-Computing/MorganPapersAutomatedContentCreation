Dear Miss Morgan:  The hot water heating plants in the small houses are not very 
satisfactory.  I think when we build the new service building all the hot water 
for everything should circulate from there.  We will have immediate hot water than
and plenty of it.

2.  may we plan to finish music room as next indoor work?

3.  I dont need swing mirrors in my bath room.  I dont suppose they are going there.
4.  I was over at the other ranch yesterday.  We should furnish the dining room and 
living room and plant a small garden.  It think some climbing roses would be good 
among other things.

What looks to be a very fine hightops in Mrs. Taylors hall; is it old or modern It 
looks like a burl walnut Queen Anne peice but of course I did not stop to examine 
it closely.

There are a couple of my mothers quilts there.  I think these are such personal things 
that I should have them here.

I will go over the Hacienda things and see what I can send to this ranch house.  
Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
