Dear Mr. Hearst,-

Regarding the list of spreads and covers sent by Mr. Byne - I had intended speaking to 
you of these in time to catch the shipment, as I had no intention of letting them send 
them without you gave the order yourself.  I regret that it slipped my mind - as you 
realize I am generally careful in such matters.

There is a client here who will gladly take the shipment as a whole and reimburse you 
all expenses incurred.

I will send the payment directly to Mr. Byne with the explanation - if this meets 
with your approval.

Yours very truly,
JM-M
