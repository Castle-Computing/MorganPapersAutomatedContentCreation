ﬂew York American,
Haw Yark,‘ H.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

_The marble walla. ate. for
tha Degas Suite is balng made and will all
be in place by thq first of Kay. There re»
malna yet to order the wash basins ~- made of
the darker "roaata", basins integral with the
alab'like\1n your House g rooms, they will
cost $1120.00 with 1633 9.8 shown in the on.»
closed out or duplicating those in House 5,
Do you want curtains or doors at the showers?
If doorst see enclosed nuts and prices.

We could get marble slabs with
porcelain bowls at a small portion of the coat
of the one pieca.ones.

If wé_make new models for thé
standards it will oonaiderably increase the
cost. ~

ﬁne rooma are taking shape
nicely. The only worry is as tozthe sitting
room wall covering. The piacoa sent not-mateh~
ing in pattarn, lengths, etc., have asked French
to send all they have in hepes of getting enough
of one pattern. The color is fine ~ and it will
quite break my heart if it will not do.

Yours veryitruly,

JM—deH
