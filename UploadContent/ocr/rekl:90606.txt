Dear Mr.Hearst:

In regard to the "Oriental Collection" inventory cards coming to you with this -

1.  No articles in use are included, so far as I know.

2.  Except for some large fish jars, no ceramics or porcelains are included.

3.  Included are some "remains"of East Indian origin that never seem to fit in.

4.  Among the Kakemonos are three in such bad condition they cannot be handled.  I 
took them to two Japanese experts here, and both said it would be necessary to send 
them to China (not Japan) to be done and that it would mean an out-of-proportion 
expense.

Also, there are a number of items of small value with missing parts that only clutter 
the records and would cost more to fix up than the articles could possibly bring -- 
can these be eliminated?

As always,

JM:F
