Dear Miss Morgan:

Mr. Keep wants a new house and should have one.  A good head gardner that I hope we 
will get should also have a house.

I do not see any reason, however, why Mr. Seastian should have a house or why the head 
carpenter, Mr. Peterson, should have a house.

I should think the double house might go to Mr. Keep and to whomever we shall select 
head gardner.

I have come to the conclusion that the present gardening plan is not so very good and 
that it is better for us to engage a competent head gardner.  I do not think we should
 take back anybody that we have had, because no one of them has been very satisfactory,
  but I am sure we can get a very good practical man, with experience, judgment in 
  handling men and with good taste in gardening, who will work harmoniously with Miss 
  Worn.

Will you kindly let me know whom you have in mind for the position of head gardner.

2.  The next house we build in San Simeon should be adjoining Poncho's and linking up 
the kind of bay shore houses.  We can build it at the time we think most convenient.  
I think it might be desirable to complete the warehouses first.  We greatly need those.

Therefore if we can get along with what houses we can build by getting rid of the 
people we do not have to provide houses for and giving the space to those we need, 
I think it would be desirable.

There are two or three little houses like the San Simeon houses that should be built 
in various parts of the ranch; one at Sancarpojo; another one at Pacific Valley, etc.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
