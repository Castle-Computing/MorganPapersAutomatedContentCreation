THINK WE SHOULD HAVE SOME MARBLE FOR BALUSTERS OF STAIRCASES IN A SELECT WHATEVER YOU LIKE BEST BUT DO NOT USE TRAVATINE FOR BALUSTERS I THINK STAINED WHITE MARBLE FOR EVERYTHING AS PER ESTIMATES OF S MILETIN THIRTY NINE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS WOULD BE ALL RIGHT I AM SATISFIED TO HAVE NICHE SHELL OF PLASTER GILDED AND FROM SHELL DOWN GOLD MOSAIC AND LOBBY WALLS OF IMITATION CAMSTONE IF YOU THINK DESIRABLE IT WOULD CERTAINLY BE AN EFFECTIVE COMBINATION
