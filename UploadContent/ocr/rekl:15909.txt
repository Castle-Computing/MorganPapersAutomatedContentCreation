Dear Mr. Hearst:

In order to make progress show, we have spent practically all our budget fund plus your very generous labor checks on labor - the last three months, - and have left our material bills such as fencing, cement, pipes and fittings for pool and filter (a large item), reinforcing steel, etc. etc. unpaid, arranging with the firms to carry as 60 and 90 days.  It was a great pleasure to see the effects count, but the reckoning is here, and it will be necessary to reverse and pay these material bills rather than labor, for the next three months or else I will have to go into hiding from creditors day times.

In planning out how to pay off, do we pay the marble for the pool from the budget fund?  If so, you can see we will have to stretch that work out.

Yours very truly,
