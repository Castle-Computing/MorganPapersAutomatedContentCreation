Mr. William Randolph Hearst
c/o Los Angeles Examiner
Los Angeles, California

Dear Mr. Hearst:

	This is chiefly as regards George Loors:
	
	The men's "Country Club House" will be completed
this week and payments on it will be finished in December. 
Mr. Loors feels his present salary, $50.00 per week, has been 
an undue weight on this particular job -- but I know the total
cost would not have been kept so low without his active and 
constant interest. 

	He had been apparently very successful in the 
general contracting business he has been developing, but says
the cost and difficulties in running it from San Simeon would 
only be warranted were he to carry San Simeon at the 1936
salary, $125.00 per week, and take only the outside work he 
conscientiously could. Otherwise, he would locate at once
with his family at some central valley point, and would be 
proud and glad to fo your work if you wanted him on some new
arrangement or as occasion required. 

	From another point of view -- if you wished to 
go ahead with the settling of the new cast and antique stone
on the Main Building -- a small crew consistin of John Vanderloo, 
who has made all the Hilltop cast work, Frank Frandolich, 
the funny little stocky Italian with the squnit eye, 
(oldest on the Hilltop,) two helpers on handling, and Peter
Petersen for scaffoldings, etc., could by working steadily
with occasional help from the trucks, make a patio easily
finished with an enlarged crew for a short time. It would 
cost approximately $2500.00 per month to run the small crew. 

As always,
	Yours truly,
