Dear Mr. Hearst:

I did not answer the query of Mr. Willicombe as to Dr. Bonnikson on receipt, as you were expecting to be back her soon.

When hunting for the "cow man" in Chico last fall Dr. Bonnikson was most highly spoken of, and the man I sent up, whose family knows well the dairying people of the northern counties, said he was an exceptionally fine man in his line. He was willing to come and take care of the Jerseys - but my man's opinion was that he should not be engaged as a herdsman, for, while he might do the work he would soon not be contented, his capacities fitting him for a much better position. The people who spoke for him knew his qualifications well and are themselves qualified to judge.

Yours very truly,
