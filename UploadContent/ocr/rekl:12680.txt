Dear Miss Morgan

I saw Mr. Hearst at his home this morning at about 11:30.  We had spent less than 20 minutes together when he was called away on another appointment.  He asked me to wait.  I waited about an hour.  Then he returned and told me he would have to postpone our further discussion until this evening and he asked me to call at 9 P.M.

Mr.Hearst looked at only the elevations (the more finished set) before he was called away.  He expressed himself as much pleased with the front and rear but considered the side overdone .  While he was keeping his other appointment I laid out the elevation Mr. Nasbaum did with the plainer gallery story so that 
it caught his eye on his return.  He said, emphatically, that it was more to his liking.  I sketched shields in above the piers where mr. Nusbaum evidently forgot to draw them and Mr. Hearst said he thought that treatment would be very good.

Mr.Hearst said he thought the drawings had more the expression of Northern Spain than of Southern Spain, but put it more as a question than a conviction.

I put the question - wood or plaster for main cornice and frieze? - to him, but we did not finish the consideration of it.  At first thought he favored wood and cited brackets of C towers as example.  I shall take that question up again this evening and try to show him that to use such an example would be deceptive.

We touched upon the question of approach from the rear.  I shall bring it up again this evening and try to lead to discussions on these two matters.

T.J.
