April 22, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

As soon as the weather seems definitely settled we will make the additions to the staircase towers, and go on and finish up the roof.  I understand the edifice between the towers is definitely to come down, but as Mr. Rossi is sure you want it left am asking again.  [Handwritten: Come down]  Also whether we shall put on the tile we have, or wait for the possibility of the Cuban tile? [Handwritten: Use our tile]

The esplanade is all poured and looks well.

Until the right people are found I have put Mr. Baldwin's son in charge of the houses, and asked Hughes to train him in the care of the beds, etc.  We know him to be both faithful and honest.

The gardener has resigned for the fifth time since last summer, and unless you think it bad judgment, I will not try to keep him, change being inevitable sooner or latter.  There is available a man with very good recommendations who has been the last five years with the Niles mursery company in charge of shrubs and flowers.  He is an Englishman, married, with no children.  Mr. Keep, I find, knows and like him, which is a consideration. [Handwritten: OK]

The lions are beauties - about the size of St. Bernards and as well kept and groomed as human babies. It seems incredible that any living creature could contain the resentment felt by those wild cats.  They have not "tamed" in the slightest.

I enclose some pictures taken last week of the new Hearst swimming pools.

Yours very truly,
