NEW YORK, N.Y.

SOUNDS INCREDIBLE BUT BYNES GRILLE IS MAIN NAVE GRILLE FROM VALLADOLID CATHEDRAL 
TAKEN DOWN TWELVE YEARS AGO IT IS COMPOSED OF THREE TIERS OF BARS WITH CORNICES WITH 
A VERY RICH RENAISSANCE TOP CRESTING LIKE BEST OF TYPE TOO MUCH BARDS FOR INTEREST 
WHICH WOULD ALLOW REDUCING HEIGHT IF NECESSARY FIRST TIER BARS MUCH LIKE SAN SIMEON 
VESTIBULE DOORS
