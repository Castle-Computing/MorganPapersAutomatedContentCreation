Dear Mr Hearst.

In fairness to Mrs Graham I regret my spontaneous answer as to her columns.  I could not have seen them here, but on thinking, may have seen them before the "quake" in her Santa Barbara shop where there were a number of really nice things, she might have brought here as her shop there is closed.

Yours truly,
