Dear Mr. Hearst:

Kreiss & Sons' men were up and got all information, measurements, etc. for making up 
the red damask hangings which Mr. Wiliams' men can take down and ship to them as soon 
as you like.  I will explain as to the use of the valance.

Mr. Rossi has all drawings for concrete work of the indoor pool, and all material from
 outside required to complete it.  The water heating, filtering, etc. layouts were made
  months ago and the work is installed so far as the progress of the concrete work 
  permits at this time. The only problem unsolved in this connection is how to heat 
  these big areas until the central heating plant develops.  The pool water will be 
  heated from the Neptune pool boiler down the Hill.

As to the Recreation Wing, I am to blame for losing time trying to use safely the 
outgrown foundations instead of having explained the difficulty to you earlier.  
However, the new structural design is well along and is a great improvement over 
the patched up one.  The foundations is mailed to Mr. Rossi tonight

As regards the blasting of the North Wing concrete, I did not see Mr. Rossi Thursday,
 but left a note explaining fully why it should be discontinued.  As this was the second 
 time recently that evidently over heavy blasts had been used, asked the opinion of some
  of our best engineers Friday as to what would be considered good practice under our 
  conditions, and they both were emphatic in stating that any gain of time might be at
   a future disproportionate cost, owing to the treacherous nature of the shattered 
   rock forming our foundations.

The surveyor returned from Hacienda San Antonio today with his report -- which had 
either to be

a short quick check-up of the government maps, or else a slow, and due to the brush, 
expensive survey. The maps will be ready this week, also grades & photographs.

Yours very truly,
