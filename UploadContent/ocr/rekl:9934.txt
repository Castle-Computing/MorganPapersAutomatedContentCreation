Dear Miss Morgan :

I have not written in detail about the bath-house building because there is no immediate hurry for it.   However, I may say that I like the general plan with one or two minor alterations.

First, I believe it would be well to have the tower in the middle of the rear wall and have the entrance through the tower.  I do not exactly like it off on one side unless it should be made on of the corner towers, as I think it was originally.

Second, I think the pool should be narrower, allowing a walk on the south side between the pool and the arcade.  My idea of the dimensions of the pool and building are something like as follows:

The pool, 20 feet wide and 50 feet long.  The court, 25 feet to the north of the pool, 25 feet to the east, and 25 feet to the west, and about five feet to the south.  The arcades, about 12 to 15 feet wide.  And the main building, about 20 feet wide and 125 or 130 feet long.

I will not discuss the dimensions of the tower, because I do not know whether we will decide to make it an entrance tower or put it on one of the corners.  I am inclined to think that as a tower it would be better on the corner, and that an entrance gate with an interesting porch could be drawn separately.

The main building is in general all right, but I do not like the big door halfway up the facade of the building.  I should think that the door would be better on the ground floor if anywhere and that a balcony with windows would be better on this floor.

I think the door is too large as designed for any floor, at least in the front.  Furthermore, I am not sure that those buttresses add anything in a decorative way, although they may be necessary as mechanical supports.

The plunge or pool on the lower floor should be about 16 feet wide, coming flush up against the north wall and have a four-foot walk on the south wall or facade side.

I think there should be an interesting porch under the trees, with a door leading out to a path along the crest of the hill.

That is about all I can suggest.  I had ideas of planting oranges and pomegranates and such trees to go with this Moorish architecture, but apparently the hill is too cold for anything of that kind.  We can probably find something however that will look a little bit tropical even if it is not.
I am wondering what has happened to all our palms.

I have a letter from Hazzard and telegrams that seem to indicate an impossible situation.  I hope we have got rid of him.

I telegraphed you about the necessity of doing work on the hill by contract.  I believe this is absolutely necessary, as I think the people up there have got into a lackadaisical habit that nothing but the presence of the contractor on the job will correct.

I realize that work cannot be done in winter on the hill.  Therefore, I think we should not try any longer to do work in winter.  Let us do our work beginning the first of April and continuing until the first of December.  This gives us eight months of good weather and good roads for main construction.  If we do anything during the winter months, it should be interior decoration.

The contractor having nothing, therefore,  but good weather to contemplate, can base his estimates on the most favorable working conditions, and not an anticipate or charge for anything unusual or especially difficult.

Material can be laid down at the wharf, transported over a good road by truck to the top of the hill, and promptly put into construction.

The labor situation is no longer a big problem, and I do not see why contract work cannot be to only the most expeditious but the most economical.

Sincerely,
