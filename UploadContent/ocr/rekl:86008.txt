PLEASE GET FROM GEORGE BISTANY OF FLEISHHACKER ZOO COPY OF HIS LETTER TO ME 
SEPTEMBER THIRTIETH REPORTING CONDITION OF ANIMALS AT RANCH AND SUGGESTED CHANGES 
WHICH SHOWS ABSOLUTE NECESSITY FOR MORE PROTECTION AND CARE AND HOSPITAL ACCOMMODATIONS 
FOR ANIMALS ALSO POSSIBLY GREATER SEGREGATION YET MAIN NECESSITY MUST NOT BE FORGOTTEN 
OF RIDING THROUGH ALL ENCLOSURES AND COMING INTO IMMEDIATE CONTACT WITH ALL ANIMALS STOP
 I SUGGEST COMPLYING IN THE MAIN WITH RECOMMENDATIONS OF BISTANY FIRST HIRING TWO MORE
  MEN AND IF NECESSARY LATER THIRD MAN BUT DO NOT THINK THIRD WILL BE NECESSARY STOP 
  SECOND REPLACING BALDWIN BY MAN OF MORE EXPERIENCE AND PERHAPS BETTER TEMPERAMENT 
  STOP BISTANY OFFERS MAN FOR CONSIDERATION WHOSE WORK HE WILL AGREE TO SUPERVISE 
  WITHOUT CHARGE STOP THIRD CONSTRUCTION OF NECESSARY SHELTERS FOOD KITCHENS HOSPITALS 
  ETCETERA WITHOUT GOING AS FAR AS=AB7 2/134=

SUPPLYING FRIGIDAIRES AND OTHER REFINEMENTS STOP I WOULD IN FACT PREFER TO ELIMINATE 
ANIMALS WHICH REQUIRE THESE ULTRAREFINEMENTS AND CONFINE OURSELVES TO ANIMALS WHICH 
NATURALLY DO WELL ON RANCH STOP FOURTH I DO NOT WANT TO RETAIN BALDWIN FIRST BECAUSE 
I DO NOT THINK HE REALLY KNOWS THE BUSINESS AND SECOND BECAUSE MOST OF SUMMER WHEN WE 
HAVE BEEN EXCEEDINGLY SHORT HANDED HE HAS BEEN AWAY FINALLY BECAUSE LOSS OF SOME OF 
OUR MORE VALUABLE ANIMALS SUCH AS THE GIRAFFES HAS BEEN DUE TO CONFLICT WITH A MAN 
WHO DID KNOW HOT TO TAKE CARE OF GIRAFFES STOP I WOULD LIKE THIS REORGANIZATION TO 
GO INTO IMMEDIATE EFFECT AND HAVE TELEGRAPHED PARKS TO COOPERATE WITH YOU OR WITH 
LOORZ OR WHOMEVER YOU SELECT AS YOUR AGENT=

W R HEARST.
