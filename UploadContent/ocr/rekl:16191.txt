December 6, 1926.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

When in Los Angeles I forgot to speak to you about the housekeeper.  The one Miss Morgan had in mind is now at the Mark Hopkins Hotel and prefers to remain in San Francisco.  We will try to find another.

I shall be in Los Angeles on Thursday - having tower drawings with me.

Yours truly,

s/ T.J.
