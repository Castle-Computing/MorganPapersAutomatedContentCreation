Confirmation of Air Mail Letter

Dear Miss Morgan:

I think that by changing radically the whole character of our lighting in the indoor 
pool and by making all the lighting indirect on the side walls, but nevertheless 
brilliant, and by putting a glass roof with lights behind it, so as to imitate the 
effect of sunlight, we can have enough diffused radiance in the building to light 
the pool to its very depths.

In other words, the effect will be like sunlight on an outdoor pool,-- at least I 
hope it will be.

I suggest that we do not up the lights behind the glass panels on the ceiling at 
regular intervals from one side of the pool to the other, because these lamps would 
be very difficult to reach when replacement is necessary.

If, however, we have strong lights with reflectors at the ends of these glass panels, 
not only will the diffusion of the light be better behind them, but the lamps will be 
more readily reached and changed when necessary.

Of course the lamps and reflectors will be behind the glass, but only at the extreme 
sides, reflecting the light towards the middle.

If this plan is successful, we can eliminate the standards, which are too spotty and 
too much on a level with the eye.

Perhaps we will not even need the glass panels if the reflectors can sufficiently 
conceal the lamps from direct vision.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
