Attention: Mr. Leggett

Dear Mr. Leggett:

Enclosed herewith is a notice of arrival from the East Asiatic Co., Ltd. covering one 
case of mechanical parts from Antwerp on the MS Falstria.

We believe this shipment to be a package of music rolls for a set of chimes but we 
have neither a consular invoice nor any other information concerning the shipment.

Will you please make whatever arrangements are necessary for the entry and delivery 
of this package, putting up whatever bond is necessary pending receipt of the consular 
invoice, and oblige

Yours very truly

Julia Morgan
