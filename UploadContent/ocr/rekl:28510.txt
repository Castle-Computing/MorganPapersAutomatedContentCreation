LEF - Mr H wants to know how much money we'd need to complete tennis courts 'pronto' - I.E. the concrete structure and play areas and fencing enclosure without frames, sash [illegible] etc - He will sent it.  Also what needed for Vermont marble people - this to August by Mr Neylan - 

This structure complete with cost about $125,000.  It will take about $65,000 to build the rough structure and finish the courts.
