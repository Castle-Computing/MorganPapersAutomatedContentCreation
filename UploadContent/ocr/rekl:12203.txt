Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The bulky excavation for the main building is well along--but there will be another month of dirt and dust before the form work begins.  As many men are working as can be handled economically.  Mr. Kincaid gave a week's holiday over the Fourth and a good many men have not even yet returned.

In looking ahead to have the furniture ready for House A, I had Mr. Kreiss go over with me the covers of the white and gold set for Mrs. Hearst's room -- the woodwork of which is repaired and ready.  The covers you will remember are in shreds.  We worked out a scheme for using the old embroidery as borders and center medallions for the seats with a new ground, but ran short on enough of the embroidery for the backs.  Four of the chairs have cane backs now and it seems to me it would make a good set if the settee back was also caned--which would give enough material to finish the set of seats.

The brocade for the bed spreads was finally found -- Mr. Joy not recognizing it because of a miss-labeling of the package.  I've planned out four spreads for B, using the same material in different ways--and think they are going to do finely.

Am enclosing a new layout for the "Between B and C" area.-It looked last night in the moolight like the stage of a theatre---the two palms doing wonders in the way of furnishing the area.
Mr. Kincaid's Swiss gardener did not materialize and a young Englishman is going down to-morrow to see if he likes the conditions.  I hope he will be duly impressed and be  a grand success as that is the weakest point now.

Yesterday I mailed a sketch of the plaza pavement suggesting the filling in of the smaller squares of the pavement with cement instead of tile. -- The main outline of the large and small squares are already in, and the effect is good.  -- Would you consider it?

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
