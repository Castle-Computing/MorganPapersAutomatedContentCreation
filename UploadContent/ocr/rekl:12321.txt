October 3, 1922

Mr. William Randolph Hearst
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

When I "revolutioned" on the hill in August, I asked Mr. Bogart to keep Washburn on the roll until you came out and decided yourself as to how you wanted the work carried on.  Washburn had a credit due him from 1919 to 1922 of about two months, and I arranged with him to take his time out in this way.  Shall I let him go permanently?

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
