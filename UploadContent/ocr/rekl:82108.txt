Dear Mr. Hearst:

Yesterday did not leave enough hours -- I should have asked you regarding:

1.	How much of a winter house you intend for the gate men -- boards - plaster - logs?

2.	Would it be possible to have a central eating house established somewhere in the 
lower part of ranch?  Meals are a problem entering into and increasing the cost of all 
the work below the hilltop.  We feed men in the Hill camp at $1.00 per day deducted 
from the wage, which could be done for all men through a common commissary down below.

3.  	We are slowly rock balusting the road in the poultry plan as per new layout. 
 When this is done, what topping would you put on -- cement, gravel, emulsified asphalt? 
  It should be something easily kept clean.

4. 	Mr. Rankin got back last night, and wants to know if eventually steam heating is
 going into the Roman bath and if so, whether he may not put the piping in now while 
 the spaces are open; - but it might not ever be needed?

5.	The "carload" photographs are with Mr. Williams with directions to bring up the 
chairs and chests and Gothic statues as soon as boat comes in, unless you instruct 
him otherwise; -- or would you prefer a grand new set-up later, say for your next 
visit?

As always,

Yours truly,
