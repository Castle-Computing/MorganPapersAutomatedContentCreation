Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive ,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

At San Simeon yesterday the day was lovely -- heliotrope, jasmine, roses, violets, fuchsias, oranges and lots of other things all as though it were a May day.

Webb, the gardener, seems to be a more successful companion piece to Keep -- and moreover they cooperate, which is worth much.  Keep has rounded out the apple orchard planting with the 250 trees lacking from last year, and will plant this week the eucalyptus (white and pink) windbreak on the bare gully side toward the north, completing the planting of this area.

the plan is to start right away getting the sequoias down onto the flats on which Keep will tentatively locate them.  Risking life and limbs on a horse -- seeing you have not provided the camel -- I will do my best to see that they are planted in the interesting ways you suggested in your telegram -- aisles, circles, and so forth.

Keep is anxious to use, with the other conifers on reservoir hill, about twenty-five sequoias in a damp spot he swears Providence has made for them.  Do you think well of this/  I understand you want the hill "forested" rather than planted group fashion.

Mr. Porter failed us Saturday and sent word yesterday that, much as he wold be interested, it would require more personal time than he cold give you.  I will try Mark Daniels next.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
