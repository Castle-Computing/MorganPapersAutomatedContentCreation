Dear Mr. Hearst,-

Storms have upset progress plans somewhat this week at San Simeon and Jolon, but no 
damage was done.

Mr. McClure gave me your message and sketch as regards the "picture gallery." What would 
you think of taking the original of the facade we are using for the "music room" for the 
"picture gallery" facade, using reproductions of it for both the music room and service
wings.

Mr. Joy will be up for this week and so as to try out ideas, as the design of the second 
story of the recreation wing may be affected.

As always,

Yours very truly,
