Dear Madam: 
	
	I have received a letter from Frank P. Dow Co. 
the forwarding agents in San Francisco with the news that 
the Gothic doors which Mr. Bartel brought here in Vienna 
were marked out by the custom authorities as being not 
antique and therefor were at my disposal. Further I was 
informed that you, as the agent of Mr. Hearst, refuse to 
accept the doors in spite of repeated invitations to do so. 
I shall herewith do my best to explain the whole matter to you. 

	Mr. Bartel had a thorough inspection of the doors in 
question and bought them at the price of lOOOO.- austrian 
shillings after long discussions in regard to the price 
from Castle Greifenstein near the Danube, where they were 
originally built some centuries ago, perhaps at the time 
before America was discovered. (It was wrong to do so.) 
Mr. Bartel himself took them over in the store rooms of the 
forwarding agent Herr Bauml here in Vienna with the obligation 
on his part of paying the above mentioned sum within 
four weeks time only under the promise that these obligation 
should be carried out in due time, did I give 
the consent to send the doors to America. From these 
explanation you will able to understand the nature of my 
claim. Mr. Bartel has bought the doors after repeated and 
thorough inspection by himself and also by the expert on 
antiquities Dr. Ruprecht, the eXpert of the Dorotheum. 
Mr. Bartel also has promised direct payment. After all this 
Mr. Bartel is responsible for the obligations he undertook 
and I intend to fight for my right with all the means possible. 
Since more than a year I have been waiting for my 
money and have been put off again and again but am not 
willing to wait any longer. It does in no way concern me 
if the American custom authorities have the intention of 
selling the doors by auction as I have nothing to do 
either with them or with Mr. Hearst. I have sold the doors 
to Mr. Bartel and shall know what to do in order to get my 
money. As soon as he enters Austria he will not be able to 
leave her again before settling accounts with me. When you 
or your firm keeps agents in Europe, which are well know as 
experts, these agents are responsible for the transactions 
they make for you. In my case Mr. Bartel is responsible 
for everything. As the correspondence I had with him was 
of no result I shall employ more drastic means in order 
to get my money. I am not at all interested, what is going 
to happen to the doors in America, as Mr. Bartel has taken 
over the consignment with the obligation of paying in due 
time. If there have been any objections in regard to thegenuineness of the antiquity of the doors they ought to have 
made in Austria before dismantling out of the walls in the 
castle. The view of the american custom authorities in regard 
to the genuineness of the antiquity of the doors seems 
to go too far. They seem to regard antiquities only then 
genuine, when the dust of centuries still stick to them. 
Anyhow should this be the case it ought to have been known 
to your agents and they should make the purchases a coordingly. 

	I hope to have given you all the explanations necessary 
and remain 

	faithfully
	Yours
