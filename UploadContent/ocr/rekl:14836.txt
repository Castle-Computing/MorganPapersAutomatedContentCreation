Dear Miss Morgan,

I am sending this by mail as picture telegraph is not sufficiently advanced to transmit any of our plans, elevations, perspective sketches or what might be called ground and lofty  drawing or collar and elbow designs

A lot of damage was done to telegraph wires in a previous attempt.  Yes'm.  Mine are not ordinary drawings

Sincerely

s/WRH
