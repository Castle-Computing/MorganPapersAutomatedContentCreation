Dear Mr. Hearst,-

As regards the poultry plant, we built the brooder house as wanted by Mr. Jones, and 
at about the price he thought it would be, but (as expected) he found it too much 
affected by changes of temperature, and a lining has been ordered for it.  He is asking 
also for chicken runs, Mr. McClure says a considerable number of them.

Should not whatever goes in down there be on a revised carefully thought out plan, so 
that the place will not repeat old conditions?  A certain amount of money, as in the 
case of the brooder house, goes in to give what the man thinks will answer; more money 
has too in to make it effective, [Handwritten: usually]

Yours very truly,

s/ JM
