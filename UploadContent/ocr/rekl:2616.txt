THINK C TERRACES ABOUT RIGHT BUT A NOT QUITE RIGHT SECOND TERRACE DOESNT SEEM TO HAVE ANY USEFUL FUNCTION SENT YOU SUGGESTION TO MAKE DEEPER STAIRS AND DEEPER UPPER TERRACE WHAT DO YOU THINK OF LOWERING UPPER TERRACE TO LEVEL OF SECOND TERRACE MAKING ONE BIG TERRACE WHICH COULD BE REACHED BY FLIGHT OF STEPS FROM LOGGIA THINK THIS BEST YET THIS BIG TERRACE WOULD BE REALLY USEFUL AND THE STEPS IN FRONT OF LOGGIA WOULD PERMIT CUTTING EVERYTHING AWAY THAT WOULD HIDE LOGGIA AND WOULD GIVE FINE ARCHITECTURAL EFFECT
