Dear Mr. Hearst,-

The lamps we ordered were in two lots, twenty-four of two stock designs and twenty-six 
to be made from our own designs.

The twenty-four of stock design are now at San Simeon and I hope Mr. McClure has shown 
you one of each pat tern.  These lamps have been paid for and the freight, duty and 
insurance, etc., have been taken care of.  The other twenty-six lamps are on their way 
across the ocean and the manufacturer has been paid; but we have not paid the duty, 
freight, etc., on these pieces.  The shipper has forwarded to us through the Bank of 
Italy a draft for $618.30 to cover the amount he advanced for freight, insurance, 
consular invoice and certificate as works of art.

The duty charged is $2300.00, fifty per cent of the cost of the lamps which we may, 
by protest, make them reduce to twenty per cent claiming them as works of art rather 
than as utilitarian objects.  However, we did not succeed in a similar attempt with 
the other lamps.

The duty will be due when the goods arrives within about eight days.

Yours truly,

s/ Thaddeus Joy
