Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
Hearst Camp,
San Simeon, California.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

These books of photographs do not cover the first shipments sent directly to San Simeon.  Photographs of most of that early material you have in the large grey covered books in the case in your House A study.  The larger part of the above material is already in use.

Many articles in the San Francisco warehouse, arriving since Mr. O'Reilly's time we have no photographs of.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
