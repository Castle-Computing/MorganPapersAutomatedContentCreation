Miss Julia Morgan, Architect,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, Cal.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I received your sketch of the flight of entrance steps going from the roadway to the house.  I think they will be very attractive and we should have them but I am not sure that they will be all that we want.  In fact, I really am sure that we ought to have a driveway to the house and since we cannot have it at the front of he house we should have it at the rear.

I advise, therefore, that the rear drive from the garage circle go up to the outside of the rear patio of the house and that ta handsome entrance be made there, with steps and lanterns and decorative surroundings, where people can arrive and step out of the automobile up to the steps into the patio.  The road can then continue and spring to the east in a loop over built up ground.  The road will join itself just above the garage circle.  This seems to me thoroughly practicable.

You will probably say where will you bring your arrivals into the house.  That requires a little study but I think they might be brought into the small room opposite the pantry.  There is a kind of reception room there or, at least, a useful room, which could be made into an entrance lobby.

If this is not dignified enough you can suggest some other arrangement but I think the main idea is sound and that it would help the house and the general layout on the hill to have two fronts.  The important front facing the small houses and this almost equally important rear one or entrance front.

2.  I think it would be a good idea for Mr. Joy to come on and bring the plans.  Send him on whenever you please and I will go over the things with him.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
