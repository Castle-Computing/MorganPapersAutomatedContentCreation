My Dear Miss Morgan:

I do not want to seem to lack appreciate of what Mr. Solon has done and is doing.  His work has been wonderful and unique.

The only point is that we would like to proceed with the work promptly from now on and try to get the work finished in the time we agreed upon.

You know best how to accomplish that.

Sincerely yours,

s/ W.R. Hearst
