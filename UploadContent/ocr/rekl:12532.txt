Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

It has taken time to have large map made showing the houses, roads, and features in the area you wish planting studies for.  It takes in the area from San Simeon up over Reservoir Hill.  This drawing will be done in a few days, and will be taken down to San Simeon to have located on it the natural growths of oak, laurel, etc., the fence  and gates, roads, and so forth.  It will serve as a basis for nay and every one to work over from now on, and will fill a real need.  the planting suggestions and studies will be made over it.

It is based on the geodetic survey in connection with Parson's small surveys, with local checking:

I have thought over your letter of December firs regarding the nature of planting and kind of studies really needed, and in one way or another will get the studies made for you as soon as possible.  I think the black walnut avenue would be fine all the way from San Simeon up to a point where the road begins to rise and where they would begin to hide the view.

The outlooks from the upper floor of the main building are going to be superb -- even from the mezzanine floor they give a feeling of vastness not more than suggested on the ground.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
