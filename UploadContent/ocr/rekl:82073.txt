Dear Miss Morgan

Mr. Rossi tells me that the two fine trees which he moved to the north terrace are 
going back very fast and that we are likely to lose them.  The gardener agrees with
 him and says that the reason is that the tree surgeons performed their surgical 
 operations in the spring when the sap was running and also that the operation was 
 too soon after the strain of moving  He says he spoke to Mr. Slattery at the time 
 but he should have to you or to me.  Mr. Slattery asked the tree surgeons if it was
  all right to go ahead and of course they said yes.  I suppose they wanted the job.  
  My private opinion is that tree surgeons are a lot of fakes anyhow.  I believe our 
  own people could do everything that they do and do it better.  Anyhow we will try to 
  do it ourselves next time -- but I hope we can save the trees.

Sincerely,
