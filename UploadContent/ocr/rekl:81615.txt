Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your cable regarding pushing the replacing of the tennis courts was relayed to me at 
San Simeon Monday.  The shovel is steadily cutting in, but it evidently will take another
 ten days to complete the excavation work.  I have scheduled with Mr. Rossi so that the 
 forms and bent steel will be ready to be placed as soon as the shovel moves out, and 
 have designed the new portion of the structure so as to allow the quickest pouring of
  the rear walls and slab possible, leaving he interior work to be done afterwards.

The elevator made its trial trip Monday and will be ready for the installing of the 
finished cab in another week.

The west terrace is cleared of debris and work in this area now centers on cleaning up,
 grading new paths, and replanting of the are between the terraces and esplanade.

Macklen is rather swamped in work, I forgot to mention that the four Italian cypresses
 in the Neptune Fountain motif are in place as well as those on "C" terrace, and that
  the "C" Terrace walls and boxes have all been lowered.  The handling and planting of 
  the trees was a really very skillful piece of work on Mr. Rossi's part -- as well as 
  was Mr. Macklen's boxing, wrapping and care of them.  They look like toothpicks seen 
  from San Simeon, but are really fine.

Everyone seems to be working in good spirit.

Yours very truly,
