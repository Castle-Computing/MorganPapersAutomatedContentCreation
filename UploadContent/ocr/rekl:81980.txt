As explained last time we took up the Hill expenses, no one month's payments on bills 
represents that month's activities exactly, except as to payroll -- and we have 
arrangements with most firms to pay for material on a sort of installment plan.  
We held up the shipments of columns, wanting to know if satisfactory before going on 
with it, but will have a large payment on them to meet next month.  We may have to pay 
this month for another shipment of the Roman pool material which arrives C. O. D. at 
this port.

We are always behind on our own commission payments -- and take them when other bills 
are not too pressing.

Yours very truly,


P.S. The apparent discrepancy above will be met, as the last payroll coming at the
 very end of this month can be paid from the first installment of the July money.
