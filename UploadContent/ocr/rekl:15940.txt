Dear Mr. Hearst:

1)  By next boat I will send down material for two more "four bed unit" helps' houses, making accommodation with what you now have for 26 people.  Would you think this enough for the season?

2)  The refrigerating machine was bought originally to make ice. It is not large enough to cool the boxes sufficiently and also to make sufficient ice in hot weather.  It will make sufficient ice, or it will refrigerate two boxes if properly operated.

3)  From my observation, it would seem that some definite person should be in charge of the machine.  The changing servants do not understand its mechanism, and do not realize that it takes several days to "freeze" a box when the machine has not been in operation, that the machine has to be kept running to keep the boxes cool, and that the doors to boxes cannot be left open without heating the boxes - anymore than those of an ordinary refrigerator can be.

4)  The Frigidaires have things happy to them - like springing leaks in their chemical pipes, breaking their belts, burning out their motors, etc., but recently their manufacturers have put a service man at Santa Barbara to take care of their machines in middle California territory.  Properly "serviced" the Frigidaires probably would be the most handy and require the least in way of continuous expense.

We have had charge of putting in a good many refrigerating plants of many makes, and note they all require careful handling.  Will check the different makes and how they have been standing up and will report later.

5)  Will explain to Mr. Fairchild what to look for in way of a housekeeper. There is a Miss Gossard who might do, - she started as office secretary in a school, is well educated, was housekeeper at the Hotel Senator, Sacramento, for a year and was before that in the housekeeping department of the Palace Hotel, for experience, and is now assistant at the Olympia Hotel, Seattle, but wants a club or country resort to run and develope herself.  The manager of the Brocklebank Apartments (the large new one north east of the Fairmont) sponsors her.

6)  In passing, I have noticed that the antique bureau and table covers, etc. are being washed and ironed out of all character.  They should be sent to a good cleaner who understands how to proserve them instead of to a laundry.

Yours very truly,
