Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed are the only photographs we were able to resurrect, showing the tree moving 
operations, although Miss Morgan probably has others in her private collection.  
These photographs were borrowed from the house movers, who performed the underpinning 
and moving operation.

In general, the program consisted of tunnelling under the tree and casting three or 
four parallel reinforced concrete girders under the main root area of the tree.  
A more or less circular trench was then dug around the tree and a reinforced 
concrete band was poured in this ring against the earth containing the roots.  
A bottom was then placed in this ring by undermining and lagging, using the concrete 
girders to support the lagging.  Timbers and rollers were then placed under the 
girders and the tree was then ready for either jacking up or moving laterally.

In some cases the moving was done by means of rollers, and, in at least one case, 
where the movement was downhill, the moving was effected by means of greased skids.

We would be glad to have you return these photographs as soon as they have served 
your purpose, as they are greatly cherished by the workman who was kind enough to 
loan them to us.

Very truly yours

Julia Morgan
