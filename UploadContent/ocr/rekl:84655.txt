La Cuesta Encantada

Dec 6/31

Mr. W.R. Hearst

Dear Sir

Enclosed find measurements for under covers for Doge 
suite beds to be worn under the lace spreads.

If possible turquoise blue would be the proper shade.

The body of the spread could be lined with a light-weight
-material, but valance would look softer without lining.

I hope I have made the drawing & measurements clear to 
you & if you would rather have me take care of this for
 you I will be glad to do so.  I thought you might like
  to do the shopping, as it is difficult for me to leave
   here just now, besides one cannot purchase quality or
    color in San Louis Obispo.
I really require six pairs of blankets.  I have mine 
pairs of the heavy winter blankets you purchased five 
years ago & they are as good as new yet, but I dont 
like using them ordinarly, I keep them in case any one
 asks for an extra blanket.  6 blue comforters 2 gold &
  2 green not too dark.  Binding on blankets could match 
  color of comforter.


Thanking you

I am
Sincerely,

F.A. O'Brien


P.S.  The Gothic Suite is in order except for a few 
articles in both rooms such as soap dishes etc.  They 
really look beautiful.
