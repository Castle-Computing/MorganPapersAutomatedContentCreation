May 1933

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have concluded that Mrs Drew is not satisfactory and that the establishment would be 
better with someone else.

I have no great complaint to make I simply do not like the woman nor her methods nor her 
entourage.

Mrs OBrien was personally spoiled and became a hostess rather than a housekeeper.  
However Mrs OBrienhad a good organization.  Or at least she permitted a good organization.

Mrs Drew is proceeding on her own initiative and sometimes in defiance of instructions 
to gather a personal following around her and to disturb the organization with which we 
were satisfied and from which we had no trouble.

As a consequence we are having a good deal of trouble.I do not say and do not want to say that this or that one of Mrs Drews new organization 
is responsible for our trouble but I definitely do say that our pleasant conditions of 
which we complain did not exist before Mrs Drew came and may cease to exist after Mrs. 
Drew goes.

I am ready to try another housekeeper

Sincerely

WR Hearst
