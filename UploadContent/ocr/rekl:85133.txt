MEMORANDUM FOR MR. MC CLURE --

FROM MR. W. R. HEARST --------------------

We want to transplant the four cypress trees from the west terrace, where they are now 
being blown to pieces in storms, to places in front of the dressing-room terrace above 
the pool.

In order to have those cypresses well places there, cement boxes as large as possible 
should be built for them.

--------

2.  The two large cypress tress at the top of the steps above the north terrace 
(one of these trees was recently blown down) should also have cement boxes raising 
the level of their earth-beds somewhat.

When these boxes are being made, it might be well to consider plans for fixing in 
those boxes the bases for some lattice-work protection for these trees during the 
winter months.

The gear ropes are too injurious to the trees, and high lattice protection which 
could carry the gear ropes would be better.

--------

3. On the east Venetian balcony there is one column of stone and the other columns 
of marble.  I think we should substitute a marble column of our own making, properly 
antiqued, for the stone column, which looks badly.

--------

4.  On the south side of the refectory exterior is a sarcophagus and some Roman 
busts.  I would rather have these on the north side as they are less exposed to the 
storms there.  I do not know that either side is a very good place for them, and 
perhaps we can find better.

--------

5.  The lighting windows of the refectory are ugly.  They are spoiled by the slab 
which goes across them horizontally, and on which the columns rest.  I spoke to Miss 
Morgan about removing these slabs, and I think I have enough columns of a harmonious 
kind to use genuine columns resting on a base at the bottom of the window.  The 
columns I have are about six feet high.

--------

6.  We have a little fountain on the south terrace outside the refectory but 
apparently no means of making it "fount."  I think some little electric motor 
should operate it.
