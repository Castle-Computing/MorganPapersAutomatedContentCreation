Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:
 
 We have been having the worst and most freakish winter in this history of California--and weather at San Simeon has only been as elsewhere.

One thing the three winters has developed is that you will have to expect three or four heavy wind and rain storms each year of real violence, storms that would not be felt so much at a lower level.

I was there yesterday in a terrific storm and inside the houses, except for the sound of the wind over the chimneys, there was no feeling of it.  The worst storm line each time is up the "plaza" side of A, and over the plaza top.  There will be nothing but steps and pavement anyway will have to be in that general locality.  Fortunately the earlier bad weather kept the gardeners from putting back the plants taken up in order to put better earth in the beds, so the plants in general are not injured.  The chief loss is in geraniums, pelargoniums and smaller p plantings.

I would have written about Hazard, but thought you would be out here before this and would prefer to talk the question over.

The orchards are well along, but general outside work has been at a standstill.  Shipping has also delayed ceilings ind interior work, which are well along so far as Van der Loo's work is concerned-- and of pretty fine quality.
The Byne's address is--

Arthus Byne,
Monte Esquinza, 6
Madrid, Spain.

Cabled tonight for the Seville ceiling and the Granada house, as per your telegram.

Yours very sincerely,
