Dear Mr. Hearst:

	Enclosed are photographs, prints,
etc., of all your material loaned to the San 
Francisco museums -- except for the data of the 
wooden St. Christopher, our office photograph 
of which we sent you as a Wyntoon possibility 
at the Bridge, some time ago, and photographs of
two varguenos which we sent you last month. 

	Mr. Loorz and Mr. McClure left
yesterday for Wyntoon to see what could be done
with local labor for the present, also to see 
with accomidations could be had for the San 
Simeon men later on. 

	As always, 
	Your truly,
	
	JM:F
	Enc.
