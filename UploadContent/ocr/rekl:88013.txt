Dear Mr. Loorz -- I want more light in the new rooms than Miss Morgan gives us.  
It will save time and money to have the lights put in at the beginning instead of 
later.  

In the lower of the three small rooms now nearing completion there is one lantern.  
There should be four or six.

I do not like the table in that room It is too big and it is poor quality.  We have 
a great number of good ones why not use one.

We should also have one or two bed side tables in all such rooms

We must get another window in that room no matter whether it is symetrical or not.  
It needs light in the day time as well as at night.

Please see that there are many connections for lights in every room 

This is a matter with me, I like a room that you can see your way

Dear Mr. Loorz

The flue in the study fireplace will undoubtedly have to be enlarged. 

There is little that can be done otherwise and the fireplace smokes at the beginning - 
takes it clear up when there is a big draught but not until the room is full of smoke. 

The fireplace cover is made a little deeper by cutting down the bricks at the back two 
or three inches and the floor oft he fireplace could be raised a couple of inches.

These things would help some but the blue should be enlarged.

s/ WRHMemorandum for Mr. Loorz:

As soon as convenient will you kindly give me more light in the Gothic Study 

If we cannot have more lights in the upper part of the lanterns at least let us have 
a good strong light there and a cluster of five lights in the lower part of the lanterns.

Furthermore I think it would be well to make lamps out of the iron candle stands and 
to put shades on them and to have about three bulbs at the top of the candles under 
the shades.

If we dont do this I will have to get a dark lantern to find my way about the place.

Oh!  and one thing more please give me white ground glass globes and not these 
chocolate ones

Sincerely

s/ WR Hearst
