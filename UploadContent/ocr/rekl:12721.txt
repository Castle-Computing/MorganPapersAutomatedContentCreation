Dear Miss Morgan

Some notes on interior M.B>

1,2,3 Vestibule to be as planned.  decoration as drawn, satisfactory.  Entrance door as planned
4.Mr Hearst has a fine pair of doors (Bronze face on wood back) it is in 6 panels filled with nude figures of all ages and sexes in various acrobatic attitudes.  He will use them in the doorway to the assembly room facing the main entrance we are to have them backed with suitable walnut paneling on the assembly room side and it just occurs to me that it would be better to swing those two doors into the assembly room because walnut paneling suitable to the assembly room would not suit the Villa Madona walls if folded back against them whereas the bronze doors would look all right against the assembly room walls.  These are not the Roberson doors, but are much finer.
5. Use the large arch door trim in the assembly Room wall (That with carry-katy-dids)
6.  No windows at ends of vestibule
7. Light the vestibule with 8 floor lamps

Assembly Room
1. Satisfactory as planned and set up with following exceptions
2. Make doors to Refectory wide as possible using our King and Coat of Arms panels in a pair on one side of mantel and making another pair to match.  Face them on Assembly room, fold back into doorway reveal and back with suitable gothic paneling.  Mr Hearst thinks Assembly Room mantel is finest thing  of its kind he has ever seen.
3. Bracket lights as shown - wire for ceiling lights
Stair Towers
Mr Hearst is much pleased with your solution 2.Various doors as planned satisfactory
3.Mr Hearst will buy figures for tops of ne(?)

Refectory
Owner pleased with solutions, but-
1.wants tapestries dropped to give full length windows.
2. does not know how many of those windows he has, but surely not 14.  You may use all there are or only one as patter for the others to b made.  Use them as you think best.  Use center columns both outside V in with the colored glass between.  Sash need not open with exception of those at ends of rows piercing stair-tower walls, which shall be openable for ventilation.
3.No table of length pictured obtainable
4.Use large side board in San Simeon warehouse on one wall,
5.Cut small doorways through end walls flanking grille.  Mr Hearst thinks serving through grille door would be too cumbersome and round-about.
6. Do not use brackets and lanterns as pictured he considers it too much of an out-of-doors scheme.
7. Rely on floor lamps and ceiling lamps like those in the Town Hall of Much, but wire for the brackets where shown.

8. No tapestry on rear wall, don't think I have one.  May get one.
9. Choir stalls.  Mr. Hearst thinks it improbable that he can get more of that design.  Those at San Simeon are all he has of that design.

Rear Entrance hall (So called breakfast Room)

1.Use eagle mantel and Mr Hearst will get another to go opposite.
2.Change window alcove to entrance vestibule heating as described in letter of 3/13 â€˜23 building gun rack on ends of recess with small windows in center
3. Use tall walnut door from Hacienda as a pair beside fireplace and make 3 pairs to match 
4. 3 ceiling lights

Separate dressing rooms for men and women to take the place of gun room 

Butlers pantry satisfactory

Passage to Kitchen
1. Close in with glass doors - something like Hacienda 
2.Use the pair of doors that was suggested for pantry to Rear Hall in doorway between passage and pantry. 3 doors through to rear court.

Library
Mr Hearst well pleased with scheme, but 
1. Wants Jonah-in-the-Whale substituted for mantel shown
2.Lighting satisfactory

Corridor and Stair to Roof and Towers satisfactory

bed rooms
1. Small woods entrance doors from gallery not glass doors
2. Mr Hearst does not like the drawings for these rooms - says they do no express the spirit of clipping submitted as model.
3. Arrangement of plan satisfactory
5. Extend two rear bedrooms and galleries to rear wall of rear Hall.  Put beds at side.
6. Stone grilles for bath room windows satisfactory.
7. Wire for center lights in bedroom ceilings and for brackets above mantels that center on walls.
Royal Suite
1. Door inside walls of Sitting Room communicating with bedrooms and places symmetrically with doors from corridors to Sitting Room.
2. Tapestries to be placed on these walls between doors
3. Use Italian mantel which according to our scheme would have been placed in Library.
4. Side toward Loggia glazed and arched as shown.
5. Bed room mantels to be made up as indicated on drawings.
6. Bath Rooms must have large (6'-10"_ tubs
7. Corridors satisfactorily  treated
8. Doorways corridors to stairs as shown with grills and collonette treatment using either antique or reproduced frames, but don't cut antiques.
9.Wire for center lights in sitting room and Loggia(?) plenty of base plugs.  2 bracket lights at sides of each tapestry in Sitting Room
10. The bed room and Bath room windows that show out side elevation (in walls opposite Sitting Room) to be small and separate with central balcony
Mr Hears doe snot like an al glass feeling in a bed room wall
11. Windows in end Loggia walls as shown on drawing
12. Do not use the diaper pattern door sin bed Room as shown.  Duplicate red doors other Bed Room and do not remove the mirrors

Way to Main Towers satisfactorily planned
Spiral iron stairs in towers to Lanterns satisfactory.
Supplementary Notes
1. It seems to me the effects of the lowered tapestries in the Refectory might not be good, but the windows should be made all full length any way.  They could be covered up partially at any time.
