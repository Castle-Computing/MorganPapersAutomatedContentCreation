Mr. Henri Cassou
Hotel Brevoort
New York City

Dear Mr. Cassou:

	After receiving your brother's 
letter I spoke to Mr. Hearst, and he replied 
that so far as he knew, the work was paid for. 

	My advice for both your brother's
sake and Mr. Hearst's sake, is for you to write
Mr. Hearst directly just such a friendly, personal,
clear letter as yours to me, -- explaining the 
situation fully, -- also the state of the work, 
which I imagine by now is practically completed.

	It was far more advanced when I saw
it in your brother's atelier, in the Spring of
1935.

	The letter should be airmailed, 
addressed to Mr. William Randolph Hearst, San 
Simeon, San Luis Obispo County, California, and 
marked personal. 

	I am sure this is the correct
way at this time to bring the matter to Mr. Hearst's 
attention -- far better that for me to present the 
case personally. 

	Very truly yours, 
	JM:F
