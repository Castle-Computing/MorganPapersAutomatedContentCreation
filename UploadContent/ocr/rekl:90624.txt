Dear Miss Morgan:

Attached is copy of the letter I have given Nick Yost for delivery of the things in 
Hazlett Warehouse which we discussed on telephone.

It is possible that they will want some authorization from you.

Will you, therefore, kindly contact them some time Monday to make sure there will be 
no hitch in deliver to Nick.

Thank you again for your assistance, and with best wishes, always, believe me,

Sincerely yours,
s/J Willicombe

Miss Julia Morgan,
San Francisco, Calif.
