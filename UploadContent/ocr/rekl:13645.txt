AS TO WOOD CEILINGS FOR CLOISTER ROOMS THINK WOULD BE FINE.  THE CEILING FROM BYNE DIRECT IS ABOUT THIRTY SIX FEET LONG AND WOULD MAKE TWO MORE CEILINGS.  YOUR TWENTY SIX FOOT ONES WOULD MAKE TWO EACH GIVING SIX SMALL ROOM CEILINGS BESIDES YOUR TEN BY SIXTEEN FOOT ONE IN ONE OF THE LARGER BED ROOMS.  SHALL THE FLOORS BE CALIFORNIA TRAVATIN OR WOULD A RED TERRAZZO OF THE SAME COLORS AS MARBLES SENT YOU DO.  TILE IS VERY UNCERTAIN OF DELIVERY.
