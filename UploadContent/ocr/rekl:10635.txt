Mr. William randolph Hearst.
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Enclosed is the plan with the two small symmetrical staircase towers and the reversed breakfast room, also a floor plan showing same ideas fitted into the old exterior with the smaller staircase.  This shortens the building and gives a more picturesque line while perhaps not so correct.

To me the layout with the breakfast room line at right angles to refectory is a very great improvement architecturally however it may be treated in detail.

I will make all the openings so that they may be filled out in various ways as you may find something you especially want to place.  A grill the size of the repeated arch looking into the court would be very effective.

If the proportions suit you, that is the only the only thing for the moment worrying me, as the details can be settled on your return.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
