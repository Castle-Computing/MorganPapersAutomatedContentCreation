April 9, 1924.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have returned by registered mail a "study of rear elevation of main building, "drawings for" new bath room, tower room House C, " and a small sketch that I cannot identify -- all of which Mr. Hearst was holding here and which he now thinks you may need.

There is still not trace of the front and side elevation drawings, for which I am sorry.

You will recall that Mr. Hearst wrote you fully about the rear elevation study.

Sincerely,
s/J Willicombe
