My dear Miss Morgan:

We must have additional housing facilities for the help.  Lack of these is one of the things that makes the situation difficult here domestically.  I doubt if we will have the house for the help built until next year, possibly not finished until late next year.  This means that we should have a lot more cabins for the help and the necessary equipment, including bathrooms.

I think we should begin building these at once and have some constructed as soon as possible to relieve the immediate pressure, which is going to be great a little later in the season.

2.  Our refrigeration system does not seem to refrigerate.  It is either not a good kind or is too small for its job.  The refrigerators in the basement are reported insufficiently cold to preserve meats well.

Furthermore, the refrigerators do not make ice, or at least, the ice making machine does not make ice and we have to buy all our ice in San Luis Obispo.  That is inconvenient and costly too.

I should think a sufficient number of big Frigidaires might solve the situation.  We have all the electric power we need and these big Frigidaires will make the temperature almost anything you please.  You can freeze meat solid if you want to.  They also make a certain quantity of ice and if we have enough Frigidaires we will have enough ice.  If, however, the Frigidaires we actually need for cold storage use would not make enough ice, they would at least make half enough, and we would not have to transport so much ice as we do now.

3. There is a question of putting in a Chinese laundry.  I am not disposed to do it.  It is a matter of adding more people to the hill and it is difficult to feed and take care of and house those that we have.

Sincerely yours,

P.S.  It seems very difficult to keep first class help on the hill.  This is partly due to the isolation of the place and the lack of amusement, and partly due to the lack of comforts or - let us say - semi-luxuries, and possibly partly due to the lack of systematic management in the domestic department.

If we could get a very competent and reliable housekeeper it might be worth while.  In fact, I think it would be well worth while during six or eight months of the year.  During the months that the place is not visited much, the housekeeper might be used somewhere else if she wanted to be.  That might add to the attractiveness of the job.

I do not think an ordinary housekeeper would be able to do the trick up here.  We would have to have somebody capable of managing a sort of summer hotel, a woman with experience, executive ability and judgment.  Those are obviously qualities not easy to find.

You might put Mr. Fairchild on the job, however, and see what he can get.

If the refrigeration system is insufficient for a big establishment like this, there are systems that are used in butcher shops and shops where they sell fresh vegetables.  There is a shop in San Luis Obispo where they not only preserve quantities of meat, but make and sell ice.  Their system is a practical one apparently.

Of course, we do not know what their troubles are, but these people could not continue in business unless they had a practical success.

I would like a change made in our system as soon as possible and suppose you get various reports from experienced people on the system they have the best results from.
