Dear Miss Morgan:

Enclosed is a list of books belonging to my mother which are stored.  I do not like 
to have books stored.  They go to pieces.  I think we should arrange in some way to
 have library shelves at San Simeon for these books.

I cannot make any intelligent recommendation for the moment, but I wish you would 
kindly bear this in mind and let us try to get these books out of storage as soon as
 possible.

Perhaps the best plan would be to make spacious book-cases in the new Gothic room that 
we intend to make by raising the roof of the main building.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst

Enclosure.
