Dear Miss Morgan:

Please fine enclosed check for $20,000 for February.

In order to continue the $20,000 it will be necessary for me to cut down the Slattery 
force to an absolute minimum.  Part of the work that Slattery has been doing has already
 been transferred to Parks.  The other part can be supervised by R.A. Clark's office 
 without the retention of Mr. Slattery.

I think, as I have already said, it can be done just as well and more cheaply in this 
manner.

I hope to have the expenses of the domestic conduct of the house and of the garden cut 
down to $5,000 or $6,000 a month.  All the rest is on Park's payroll, as I understand 
recent adjustments.  If all the rest is not on Park's payroll t better be immediately 
transferred thereto.

Beginning the first of May we will, I hope, be able to loosen up a little.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst

Enclosure-check.
