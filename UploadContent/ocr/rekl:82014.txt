Dear Miss Morgan:

I have marked the enclosed bill from N. Clark & Sons of San Francisco (April 26, 1929 
-- for sewer pipe) for Mr. Clark to pay.  I do not know how it should be charged, 
however, --whether to construction work or to Mr. Slattery.

I have arranged with Mr. Clark for the construction work-- that is, Mr. Rossi's 
department and everything included-- to have $45,000 per month.

I think this will be able to cover all contingencies if we do not get in too deeply.

Mr. Slattery's department is to be held down to $15,000 per month.

This will be $60,000 all told, which is about all that I can afford to spend on the 
Hill.

For three months, however, I am allowing Mr. Slattery $3000 a month for road 
construction from the Hill to the Burnett.

Sincerely,

s/ WR Hearst
