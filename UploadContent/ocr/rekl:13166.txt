Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

The type of stall enclosed I am afraid would not make a good wainscot for the Main Room because of its projecting cornice.  Our stone door trims, mantel shelf, tapestries, etcetera would be very difficult to manage, for if the stalls are not exactly of the right height, they offer little chance to adjust.  I really think a "panel and stile" effect on the order of the fine one in the photographs you gave me, could be more successfully handled.  Our height limit is 8'-2" or 8'-4" approximately.

If you come across andirons in this winter's sale, there will be a need for a good many pairs -- all sizes.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
