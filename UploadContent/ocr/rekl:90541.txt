Dear Miss Morgan : 

	Mr. Hearst said today that he would like to 
have another dozen of those bronze placques or has reliefs of 
his mother that you had made in France, and told me to find out 
how much they would cost. 

	HE WOULD LIKE THEM IN GREEN.BRONZE.
	
	I told him that I thought they had been made 
by a friend of yours without charge, but he said he did not want 
them that way; he would like to pay for them. 

	Also, he would like to get some of the smaller 
ones with the inscription on the back. He would probably want 
a dozen or more of those, according to the price. 

	Also Mr. Hearst said he did not know if there 
was an inscription originally on the large one. I told him I 
thought he had asked to have it left off. Then he said, 
regardless of whether or not there was an inscription on the original 
larger one, he would like to have it on the dozen green bronze 
ones he now desires. 

	Will you please let me know about this at your 
convenience, and oblige, 

Yours with best wishes, -

J WILLICOMBE
