Dear Miss Morgan:

There are two things I talked over with Mr. McClure before leaving the Ranch.  Both 
seemed rather important.

The first one is, the windows on the second floor of the new wings.

We devised two plans by which we could have genuine windows on the court side and keep 
this from being in any sense like a well.

The plan that provides for the two double windows with balconies seems to be the 
better, because the windows will balance better.

But if this is not practicable, I think the other one will do, because the balconies 
will balance, notwithstanding the fact that over one balcony will be two  windows 
and over the other will be one.

Still this latter is not the mt pleasing plan.

The second matter discussed was the communicating stair tower for the two bedrooms 
in the new towers - shall we call them - that we recently devised.  We discussed the 
idea of having a small stair tower running up at one corner.

This has numerous disadvantages.  First, the climb would be long; second, the stairs 
would be narrow, and, third, in wet weather the occupants of these bedrooms would 
have to go outside the house into the yard in order to reach this stair.

All three of these things are disagreeable.  I think they can be avoided by 
eliminating that tall narrow stair turret altogether and managing communication from 
the octagonal towers of the main building.Miss Morgan--2.									June 3, 1930.

I believe an oriel window could be put in beginning one flight up and connecting 
each octagonal tower with this new square bedroom tower.

The oriel could I think be made rather attractive architecturally and would have great 
value practically.

The lower two bedrooms could be reached from the main house tower, after having ascend 
a flight, as the oriel window would begin one flight up and the first floor bedroom 
could be reached through it.

By continuing up this main tower sufficiently the second floor bedroom with the new 
square tower could be reached through the second floor of the oriel.

Furthermore, by taking the elevator off the assembly room up to the cloister arcade 
this second floor room in the two square towers could be reached without so much 
painful climbing and in no case would it be necessary to g outside in the cold and wet.

Finally, I think the oriel window would look better than the narrow shaft of a stair 
which we had under consideration and would tie everything together better and not 
make the bedrooms in these two square towers look so isolated.

I did not have time to have Mr. McClure work out any sketch.  If I have been able to 
convey the idea by this letter you won't need any sketch.

I am expecting to leave Thursday night for the East.  Any communication you may have 
for me will reach me in Los Angeles up to that time.

Sincerely,
