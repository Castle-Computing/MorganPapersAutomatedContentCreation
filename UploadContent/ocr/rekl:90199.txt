Dear Mr.Hearst:

These came in from Mr.Kower a few days ago -- since then, two additional feet of 
snow has fallen.  

At San Simeon, Mr.March has done his best to protect the plants, but the area to 
cover was too great and there will be some loss.  It has been continually freezing 
even with the rain.  However, the farmers have had their innings.

A the Beach House, a few chairs for the new library are badly needed.  The red and 
green wing chairs, satin damask covered, look well.  The very low modern chairs of 
old library, tried for effect, do not look well.

You are not missing any fine days hereabouts.

Very truly yours,
JM:F
