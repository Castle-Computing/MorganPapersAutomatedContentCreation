January 8, 1926

Dear Mr. Hearst:

You were right in thinking me mistaken i the cost of the Bottocino marble for the attic vestibule - as I realized tonight that my mind was not functioning.  I remembering budgeting the finishing of the main vestibule and the finishing of the patio entrance as approximately equal for marble, viz - $8000.00

I telegraphed to the office for the figures - received just as I was leaving tonight - which are as follows - (etc. se telegram attached.)

Yours very truly,
