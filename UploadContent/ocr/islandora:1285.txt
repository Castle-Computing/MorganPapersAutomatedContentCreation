Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Down at the Hacienda there are two red twisted Spanish Rococco columns with grapes and leaves in gilt which would make the basis of a striking matel for one of the houses.  It would require red and gold wall treatment and dark wood work.  There are also those two extremely handsome carved polychrome colored columns with the little canopys and busts, putti etc.  which were evidently used as an engaged decoration.  I can see these as a part of the great fireplace in the main room of the central building.  Had you a special plan in mind for theme?

The Duveen columns are too high, of course, for the small houses, although the ceiling height in these will be around eleven feet, depending ont he depth of the caissons in each room.

I am planning to use two pair of columns in the sitting room of House "A", making the division beyween the library wings and the central portion, provided you approve; also another pair in the lobby either side of the door opening into the sitting room.

There has been modeled a door frame and cornice following the general design indicated on the quarter scale elevation for the main entrance door of House "A" on the court side.

The last of the casting crew with Mr. Van Der Loo leave tomorrow for San Simeon I am happy to say.  They are an expert crew and can do anything in their line that can be done any where.  I told Mr. Van Der Loo that as soon as possible after arriving down there, to cast one piece of every motive and to assemble the parts together so that a photographer can take the photographs for you.
