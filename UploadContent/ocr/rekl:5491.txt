Dear Mr. Hearst:

The little model of House A will be dry enough to send by the end of the week and will give you a good idea of the new effects.

The study of the pergola makes necessary a decision as to where it shall begin and it is wound up with the garden treatment of the front of "B" and the new "turn". I will send these studies as soon as possible, on paper first for your suggestions. Owing to the fall below "B" being of rock, it will act as a filter bed drawing off the water from the soil, so think a large amount of paving relative to the flower beds advisable. 

The "Rising Sun" figure at Gump's is 57" high and could be raised up so as to count well against the arched recess.   I could not find the other statuary you mentioned.

Our shipping is giving trouble again, the boat suffering injuries from these last severe storms and on the dry rock.

Yours very truly,
