April 5, 1933

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Will you allow me to bring up here, for a time, the photograph albums from the Hill 
library, covering your stone and marble architectural elements.

We can then draw a number of the more important treasures to scale and have them to 
try out on the various newly treated facades.

We will bring back safely,

As always,

Yours truly,

s/ Julia Morgan
