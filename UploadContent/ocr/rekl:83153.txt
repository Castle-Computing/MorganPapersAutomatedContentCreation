November 4, 1929

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your personal check #909, dated November 1st, for $13,950.00 to cover cost of 
carload of pipe for Pine Mountain Line, San Simeon, was deposited in the Bank of 
Italy and the bill paid Dunham, Carrigan & Hayden.  This line is well along.  Mr. 
Huber will inspect again this week.

Yours very truly,
