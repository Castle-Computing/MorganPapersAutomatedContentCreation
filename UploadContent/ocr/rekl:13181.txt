Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, New York.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Passing Gump and Company's windows I have stopped several times to look at a long sort of enclosed console of Italian workmanship with wrought iron doors, as it suggested a possible solution for the radiators in the social room.  It is polychrome and probably would not fit in, but I asked them to send you a photograph of it, so as to get the suggestion to you.  This is so you will understand on receiving their letter and enclosure.

Yours very truly,

JM-deM
