Dear Mr. Hearst:

Mr. Maybeck has out here Mr. Frederick E. Morgan, president of the University of St. Louis (Christian Science),  the general scheme for which Mr. Maybeck is engaged on.  He is very anxious to know if you will let him show Mr. Morgan San Simeon as an example of how irregular ground formation can be made an asset to a scheme, and asks permission to make a detour on their way up or down the coast early next week and spend an hour or so on the Hill.

Yours very truly,
