Dear Mr. Hearst,-

Before your telegram came, I realized the Hill friction in regard to the trees and 
had arranged for Mr. McClenahan to go up and investigate the cause of the condition 
of the trees.  Before this report came, I was at Jolon and noticed the oak trees all
 the way along the road were struck with a blight as well as those around the new 
 buildings at Jolon.  Next day at the Hill I recognized that the trees the men were 
 quarreling over were struck with the same blight - a reddish mildewish scale consuming 
 entirely the leafage, twigs and small branches, eating them up in two or three days 
 after the first appearance of the trouble. Since then I have heard that the trees
  all over central California are reported attacked in a similar way.  The blight 
  strikes trees irrespective of weather, or whether watered or not watered, preferring 
  the healthiest trees.

The trees on the tea terrace have been stricken both with this blight and with a 
fungus root growth.  Mr. McClenahan had Mr. Webb remove the flowers and is cutting 
out;the large mushroom like tubers under the surface of the ground.

The oak room disease is a common California one, and the extra watering needed for 
the pansies, etc., has been favorable for its development.

Am buying for you the spraying outfit as offered in enclosed letter, as this is a 
very reasonable price, - you approved purchasing one last winter but a new one at 
around $1000.00 seemed extravagant - and hand pumps were used.  The spraying will be 
done right away and I have asked Mr. Webb not to replant around the tea terrace oak
 until just before you return so as to givethree oaks time to recuperate under more natural conditions.

Mr. McClenahan says neither watering nor the use of too string "manure" 
is to blame for the conditions, except to the extent that the flower beds around 
the trees requiring much watering keep the roots in a more damp condition than they 
are accustomed to and may provoke incipient root fungus into active growths.

Very truly yours,
