Miss Julia Morgan, Architect,
Merchants Exchange Building,
San Francisco, Cal.

Dear Miss Morgan:

Acknowledging your letter of September 5th, Mr. Hearst instructs me to tell you that he agrees with Mr. Keep, who is anxious to use, with the other conifers on reservoir hill, about twenty-five sequoias.

Mr. Hearst would also like the hill "forested" rather than planted group fashion.

Sincerely
s/J.A.Murray
Secretary to Mr. Hearst
