Dear Mr. Hearst:

The butler Mr. Fairchild found is of pleasanter personality than the one who had the good recommendation from the Spreckels family and might be less disturbed by not having every day exactly like the day before.

This man was four years with the Olympic Club and has worked as butler in private houses. He would have to give two weeks notice before leaving his present employer.

What I have tried to impress on the applicants is that when you are not on the ill, and they have no duties as ÒbutlerÓ proper they are to do ÒhousemanÕsÓ work in keeping the rooms, pantries, etc. clean, aired and in order.

Yours very truly,
