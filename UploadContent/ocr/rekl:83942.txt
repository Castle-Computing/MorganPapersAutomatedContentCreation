Dear Mr. Hearst;

Enclosed please find the invoice of the shipment of Bedspreads and runners.  The 
four linen runners are a gift of my wife.

In sending these I realize perfectly that it was not a definite order on your part.  
Both Miss Morgan and Mrs. O'Brien felt the need of the spreads and runners and said 
they would be grateful if we would send them subject to your approval.  Though marked 
lower than on my books I have further granted you a ten % discount.

Thanking you for your attention,

Sincerely,

s/ Arthur ByneLos Angeles Examiner

Dear Miss Morgan:

I do not know anything about these antique textiles which Mr. Byne is sending, as 
referred to in his letter of May 18th.  Perhaps some few of them might be useful.

But I think we have a lot of silk spreads stored away in drawers and cupboards not 
now being used.  Consequently I do not think we want any more.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. HearstMedieval Spanish Art Renaissance
