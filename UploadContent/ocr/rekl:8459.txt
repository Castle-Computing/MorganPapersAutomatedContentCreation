Dear Miss Morgan,
I seems that we might do the dining room kitchen pantrys &c in the basement at once.  We might also do the billiard room terrace &c and also reconstruct the living room and library.  This would not greatly interfere with the people in the house, especially
if the dining room billiard room terrace &c were done first.

What do you think I believe this could very well be done now and the bed rooms on the main floor and upper floor postponed until next summer.

Sincerely,
s/ W R Hearst.
