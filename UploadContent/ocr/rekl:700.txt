Mr. William Randolph Hearst,

New York City, N. Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

On my return from San Simeon where I made a final checking up, I mailed you a plot plan of the little houses showing the layout of courts, roadway, etc.  I have studied over this all the year and it seems to me the solution - The circle will not count as such, or as a formal line from any point, as the trees, shacks, contourrof the knoll will always partially hide it.  It disengages the houses well and each court would be very different and attractive.

House "A" would have a fountain at the bank end, and the larger court produced by letting the drive cross through it (so as to speak), will disengage the front of house and allow the doorway to be seen from a proper distance.

House "C" would have a long deep seat recessed into the bank ar a point opposite the beginning of the stepped path down to its court, which would be less formal and  more flowery than the others, suggested by the tree whose branches over-hang  the entrance to it.

House "B" would have a smaller court entered on axe, and would count on the gardening  either wide to help make it attractive.

I hope to have the heavy machinery ( rock crusher, etc.) off the sites in another two weeks and would like to rough this scheme out before you arrive even though no finishing at all could be done.

 Opening the cases has been a pleasure with many surprises, catalogues, descriptions not really expressing much.  The friezes , the ceiling panel for the big room, those lovely black and rose columns, etc. are great. While taking notes the other day Virginia Somers ran to her mother and I heard her begging her to come out and see the "moth-eaten statue." 
The doors you suggested for the main house are in pretty bad shape, and you may decide to use them elsewhere when you see them again.  Those curved walnut doors are magnificent, and I like the short Gothic ones very much.

Every one has had bad luck with photographing the details of modeling on the mountain.  I tried a large number of films this trip and hope some of them will be good enough to enclose when returned from the printers tonight.

Yours truly,
