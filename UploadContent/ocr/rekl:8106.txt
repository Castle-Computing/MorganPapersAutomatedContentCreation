Mr. William Randolph Hearst
137 Riverside Drive
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

This morning I returned from San Simeon, where since the rain has held up, the principal activity, calling for the use of all trucks and men, has been the getting up of enough soil for your planting.  Enough is up now in the courts and along the main promenade.  On account of extra hard north winds and frosts, most of the plants sent up are being acclimatized in an improvised nursery.  Very few will die but a good many have lost their leaves.

The main work of the day was laying out and checking the new axis, as the men will be ready to start on the new terraces right away.

The possibility developed of leaving the little oak, and making the proposed pool the shape of the enclosed jotting, putting the Galatea at the head.  It would make quite a romantic touch, if the leaves from the oak did not make it impossible to keep the pool clean. You were correct in stating that the measure quoted in the telegram was wrong, 5 feet being copied instead of 3 feet.

The reason for not sending you drawings for the lower wall and pergola is because of not reaching a solution which seemed satisfactory. Yesterday on a path on the level of, and along the line of the proposed wall and pergola, with here and there incidental pergolas, would be more happy than the former idea, - with a simple rambling wall below, running up and down the hills, taking in some of the greenery below A, coming out below the lower terraces of both C and B, so on ultimately around the hill.  Would you think it a good plan to put in the walk, which would be a part of the wall and pergola scheme, or of the walk and pergola scheme, along the proposed line, and leave it in that stage until you see it?
I  very  u - -
