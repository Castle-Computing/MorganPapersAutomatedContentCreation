Dear Miss Morgan:

The cost of the chicken houses is so much more than I expected, I am not disposed to proceed with them at present.

I advise that a large, permanent pool or lake be excavated for the water fowl, ducks, geese, swans, etc., and that temporary chicken houses be erected of an ordinary, comparatively cheap kind.

In the meantime we will try to reduce the expense of the chicken houses by modifying the plans and will perhaps erect them along in the summer or fall.

Sincerely yours,

s/ WR Hearst
