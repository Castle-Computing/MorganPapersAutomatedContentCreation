March 18, 1925.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Your telegram reminded me of a very fine collection of several thousand Exposition films taken with unusual understanding by an Oakland firm.  They are largely post card size and cover fully the statuary courts etc.

On inquiring today we find that the films are intact, but no prints.  It will take some days to get them printed, but I ordered the full collection.

I will get together the several books published, but they do not cover as these cards do.

Yours very truly,
