MR. WILLIAM RANDOLPH HEARST,
137 RIVERSIDE DRIVE,
NEW YORK, N.Y.

ROSSI REPORT WAS EVIDENTLY MISLEADING AS NO QUESTION BUT THAT MRS OBRIEN HAD HOUSE FLOWERS FIRES AND LUNCH READY FOR GUESTS.  THERE IS EVERY INDICATION OF CARE AND ORDERLINESS IN HOUSEHOLD.  SHE MADE MISTAKE IN GOING TO SANLUIS FOR QUICK TRIP ALTHOUGH WITH ROSSI'S KNOWLEDGE AND APPARENT APPROVAL AS HE LOANED HER HIS CAR FOR FIVE HOURS TO GO SAYING HE WANTED TO SHOW GUESTS AROUND HIMSELF AT GEORGE HEARST'S REQUEST.  WHO IS BOHN UNDER?  HE AND ROSSI ARE DEVELOPING TOMKIN-LIKE FEUD.  MONDAYS TROUBLE DUE TO THIS.  THINK WITH YOU HOUSEHOLD SHOULD GO UNDER SLATTERY BUT AFTER BEING WITH HIM YESTERDAY BELIEVE BETTER GIVE HIM LITTLE TIME TO FAMILIARIZE HIMSELF WITH GENERAL CONDITIONS BEFORE ASSUMING IT.

JULIA MORGAN.
