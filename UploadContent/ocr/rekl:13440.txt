Miss Julia Morgan
San Francisco, Calif.

Dear Miss Morgan:

I have not clearly in mind what you mean by not having sufficient base for the large house.  I suppose you mean the big central house.  I imagine you mean that the esplanade does not make a wide enough sweep.

I know on the contour lines it does not follow the contour; and I remember that when I was talking about the esplanade and surveying it with an eye, I always though of the esplanade as going below the big tree on the slope north of the house, instead of above it.

I have indicated what I mean with ink marks on the blueprint.

We could, therefore, make the esplanade sweep below that tree and possibly make a corresponding sweep on the south side, if you thought this desirable.

It is a little difficult for me to discuss this situation.  The esplanade was not laid out when I was West, and I cannot visualize its effect, never having seen it.  I can say, however, that if this is what you mean, it would be perfectly satisfactory to have some such a readjustment of the esplanade made.

I cannot see that the difference in either case would be very tremendous, however, and I think you are perfectly safe in going ahead and doing whatever you want to do in the matter.

I do believe that there would be some practical utilitarian advantage in having the esplanade go under the big tree to the north of the hill, and the other trees to the south of the hill.  In other words you could arrange under those trees very delightful resting places, and add tot he attractiveness of the esplanade in that way.

I not that people are accustomed to assemble under those spreading trees and I advise that even if you do not change the course of the present esplanade that you make some kind of a terrace, running out under the big tree tot he north and another similar terrace under those trees to the south.

I believe that we would be repaid for any trouble in this respect by the picturesqueness and attractiveness of those sites.

I am returning the blueprint with the markings indicating a wider turn to the esplanade both above on the north, and on the south.  If this is practicable, please do it; if not, please make the terraces.

Sincerely,
s/WR Hearst
