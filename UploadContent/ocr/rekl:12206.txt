Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst;

Saturday I took the new gardener to the hill and spent two days showing him what as to be done immediately.

He is a born gardener and started actual gardening at eight years old on  a fine English estate, working on several famous places before coming to America.  He has all the technical knowledge of Hazzard or Mulhall, with practicalness.  Also, his head is squarely set upon its base and I do not think will be easily turned.

He is taken on probation, subject to your inspection, at a salary of $150 a month.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM

P.S. The hole is growing and boxing should begin by the end of the month.
