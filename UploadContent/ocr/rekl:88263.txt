Monsieur C. Cassou
18 rue Morere
Paris, XIV

Dear Mr. Cassou:

	Enclosed is a plan and some photographs
of the "Neptune Pool" in its present (uncompleted) stated.
The recess off the main pool and the small pool above to 
receive your "Neptune" group I have not touched since my
visit with you last year - so please do not think of them
except as something yet to be done to from a proper background
and setting for your "Venus" as well as your "Neptune" statuary.

	Also, I have not placed any revetment 
on the four end pylons of the semi-circular pavilions because
I wanted to be free to make the mouldings, marble jointings, 
etc. conform properly to your compostions.

	Mr. Hearst feels the photographs of 
groups suggest something too elaborate for these pylons,
given the need to focus attention on the main statuary. I have
indicated the location of these groups by red arrows on the margins
of the photographs. The Verde Antique bases are temporary - can 
be made any dimensions you wish - but a jet d-eau is to come from a head
in the face of each of the four pylons and from the base (also 
temporary) of each of the swan groups. The water pipers are 4 inches
in diameter and then a strong stream from each base with the pool.

	I have but a background of Verde Antique marble behind
the "Venus" statue because she ? the white marble of the ? ?. Of 
course I have not yet put in the little cross wall in the upper
pool necessary to raise ? the new "Neptune" group. Page 2.

	Your suggestions as to the whole question
of setting, color, etc., would be greatly appreciated.

	The water you see in the pool is from four feet
to twelve feet deep - absolutely clear, and at all time of a 
turquoise color, giving for some reason I cannot understand, clear
emerald green reflections on the white surfaces of the pavilions
walls, etc.

	There is still much to be done - except the ? the permanent
planting is not yet made, the glass light halls are of ? temporary
and the balustrade by the
temple out of scale etc. but I begin to see a day ahead when 
this all will have a ? appearance.

With the best regards, 
Very truly yours,
