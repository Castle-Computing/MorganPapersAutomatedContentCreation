May 16th, 1924.

Mr. William Randolph Hearst,
137 Riverside Drive,
New York, N.Y.

Dear Mr. Hearst:

Would you want to use the "German Venus Panel" opposite the doorway in the Lower Suite House A or would  niche with the stone figure (photograph enclosed) be more satisfactory?

The House C suite is far enough along to make one sure it is going to be very livable.

Yours very truly,
JM-deM
