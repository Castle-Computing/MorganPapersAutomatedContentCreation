What would you think of using tho some
"head motif" ovsr doors and windows of the
sitting room of g, as is in the central ooil~
ing motif, with small statues, (originals
plus copies) over the pilssters? It might
be interesting~~s_ uttoohing sketches.

The columns for tho hﬂmy end of tho room
are still in question. it sooms to mo rope
-licss of those under she big boom wOull be
tho most sotisfootorg~~but quite a piece of
work to do. The next best might be one of
tho pairs of twisted oolumns. Tho rod hang»
ings sno valance behind tho columns will be
quite solondio in thmsslVos.

It has been a tug 0“ war to got the-
mooolors to siozo the character of tho queer
little musicians panels for the lower lobby
frieze, jut they have oocomplished it st last.
The ceiling with the shields is done, but the
“Hero” documents are evidently still in ous-
toms; so that coiliqg is still to do. I on—
01030 a letter from-ﬁrs. Byno concerning it.

I have used mirrors on the bash ﬂoors.
set out in deep mouldings to cover the dosf~
suing packs, as they were less eXponsovo and
more sound proof than wooden panels.h Have
also st lost found a weather strip-~desfening
strip-«concern that knows its business. So
that worry is over. ‘ ' ‘

‘Am sending by Wells Fargo Txpross the

Swimming pool model. It is more delicate than
the others, but hOpo it arrives safely.

Yours Very trulyv
