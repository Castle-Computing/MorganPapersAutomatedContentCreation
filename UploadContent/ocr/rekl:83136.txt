MISS JULIA MORGAN
1135 MERCHANTS EXCHANGE BLDG SANFRANCISCO CALIF

I HAVE SENT THE FOLLOWING NOTE TO MR ROSSI REGARDING STEEL QUOTE AS I UNDERSTAND 
YOUR PROBLEM IT IS THIS YOU HAVE PUT THE IRON FOR THE NORTH TERRACE ON THE OUTSIDE 
MISS MORGAN THINKS THE IRON SHOULD BE PARTLY ON THE OUTSIDE AND PARTLY ON THE INSIDE 
THE ENGINEER THINKS YOUR IRON ON THE OUTSIDE WILL BE SUFFICIENT BUT THAT IS NOT THE 
QUESTION STOP MISS MORGAN IS THE ARCHITECT AND IF SHE WANTS IRON ON THE INSIDE TOO 
PLEASE PUT IT THERE STOP YOU SAY YOU WILL HAVE TO TAKE DOWN SOME OF THE IRON ON THE 
OUTSIDE STOP NO YOU WILL NOT STOP I THINK I CAN TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO SAY IN 
ORDER TO SAVE TIME LET THE IRON THAT IS ON THE OUTSIDE REMAIN AS IT IS AND ADD THE 
IRON THAT MISS MORGAN WANTS ON THE INSIDE THIS MAY WASTE A LITTLE IRON BUT IT WILL
 SAVE A LOT OF TIME STOP ANYHOW IT WILL GET WHAT MISS MORGAN WANTS WHICH APPARENTLY 
 IS EXTRA STRONG CONSTRUCTION WE WILL HAVE MORE THAN EXTRA STRONG CONSTRUCTION STOP 
 SHE OBJECTS TO ANYTHING BEING TOO WEAK AS FAR AS I UNDERSTAND STOP I HAVE NEVER KNOW 
 HER TO OBJECT TO ANYTHING BEING OVERSTRONG SO I THINK YOU CAN SAFELY GO AHEAD ON THE 
 BASIS I HEREIN RECOMMEND IF THAT IS NOT RIGHT WILL YOU PLEASE CORRECT IT
