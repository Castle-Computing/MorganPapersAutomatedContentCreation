Dear Mr. Hearst-

In principle, what you say is correct, and I will get you the estimate with the office sketches so far as possible.  But you took the figure for the total paid Suppo to date for all his work, for the cost of the furniture.  The total figure of 2545.00 included payments made to him and previously shown on the same certificate, the over doors of the court of "C" (with the heads in the baskets), the big door below A and the big door below C and a number of mouldings. 
I told Mr. Joy some time ago to tell you that the set made for your bath could easily be disposed of if you wish. Which will lean the cost of the set used, fairly reasonable as a small change would make it into a good boudoir set.  

As always,
Yours Sincerely
Julia Morgan.
