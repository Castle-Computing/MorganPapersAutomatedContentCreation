Dear Miss Morgan:

I understand the plan to be -

Firat that we will figigh the terraces
which we are actually Working on Â£33, - namely
the South terrace, the terrace in front of B,
the terraces on each side of the pool and the
plaza terrace in front of the main house. L

Then we will do the interior pool
and baths under the tennis court and the new
roof to the main building.

Incidentally we will install the
elevator and the bells if thalarrive.

I imagine these things will carry us

until about Christmas.

(Signed) n. a. H.
