Dear Miss Morgan:

Please make a little model of house B. I have A and C and would  like to have B, with the new terraces. Of course there is no hurry  for this-- whenever you can conveniently have it done.  

2. We ought to have a dove cote on the hill and we ought to have  a decorative water tower. Will you please consider the locating of  these tow things?  

3. Have you also considered where we should put the swimming pool  and structures around it? You will remember we were discussing  whether we should put it on the flat below where we had our tents  last year or whether we should put it on the hill northwest of  house C.  

The latter would seem to be the place where any architectural  effect would be best seen; and still, it might not be the best  place to have it.  

4. I am sending out a lot of flowers, seeds, and vegetable and  grain seeds. We ought to have someone down there not only to plant  the flowers but to lay out a vegetable and grain patch. The  vegetable and grain should be laid out down near the farmhouse, and  of course the flowers on the hill.

Sincerely,
s/ WR Hearst
