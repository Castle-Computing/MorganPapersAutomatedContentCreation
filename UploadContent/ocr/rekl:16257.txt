f: Dear Miss Morganz- ‘ A v ’ V’:
g: ' I hereby transcribe some instructions I received
i; . from MI.-Hearst yesterday.:" - '

Dear Mr. 30831: I am going to put in one_-;
g“ .elevator and one only. That will be in the North-West tower. Any bbdy i
3 in the Dgges suite who doesnt want to climb to it on the East stair. i

cases, can go up in the elevator to the library floor and walk alon§~
the corridors and down to the Doges suite. The one elevator will e“r-

ve the Library, the Gothic suites and the tower rooms. I want to make é
a bed room of the room East of the study. the room where we are going *
to put the hLAdASTER MhNTEl. We can make a bath room of one of the alco-*
ves and a closet of the other. Also.please make immense closets of the
Space east of this bed room where I-can store all kinds of clothes. per- ’
sonal things etc. Run these closets clear through to the East wall and
light them as the stud is lighted from the top. (2) I will make bed
,rooms of the towers an .restore the bath rooms on the roof which we- ,3
tried once and then took down.‘ The towers are higher now and will not’i
appear dwarfed. Then we need the bed rooms in the big house for winter“

g“,‘ weather, It is a nuisance to go to the cottages through the rain. I ~

g . ¥ - With this layout we will have twelve bedrooms in the main house. -(5)

3 't The above plans are sufficiently sane, the following may not seem to
be so, but please take them up with Miss Morgan. .First I wonder when

;, we build the new cottages E and F if we could build a tunnel passage

Q: ~ 'connecting them with the cellar floor of the towers in one case and _‘

a - v with the amusement wing in the other case so we can reach the main househ
in rainy weather. Second, I wonder if we could take down the towers offw‘
C and erect them much larger so that the bath rooms for the main floorFiu
would be big and fine and also that the upperv tower room would be veryﬁﬁ,
fine and large. Third, I have a plan for A but it is difficult“toﬁwj

; ;<,p; ' “explain so I will talk to you about it. Finally can we put someg,,,»

ksoumd proofing in the walls and ceilings of such houses as we build gaaag;

or rebuild. It keeps people in the bed rooms from being annoyed byhths;
Phonographs and radios and maniacs in the parlors. Otherwise I-guﬂﬁﬁﬁ i

we are all right for a few days any how. W.R.H." "Please get eppyaef;§ ie

my telegrams to-Miss Morgan in which I ask for several important impregig?

‘vements. Please help all possible to have these various things furnief i7

shed as early as may be. Here are some other things which must pesigg a

'ively be done rom t1 (1) You must get more power into the houses beygg

e can have more eat and more light. The heating plan we have laidihhﬁﬁﬁ

ggy‘ 1‘» but we must also have light. We should have four standards in each effﬂfg}
gig; pg) the four large rooms of A and at least two of these in each room shoulhﬁﬁﬁ'
ﬁgiggl . have a cluster of lights so as to give liberal illumunation. We mustwﬁggi
ﬁﬁé 7C; have ample illumination in all the rooms of the little houses and thee §ﬁg
H¥t"~ big house. They are as§a rule underlighted- A130 Please 33°F COlerin he}
