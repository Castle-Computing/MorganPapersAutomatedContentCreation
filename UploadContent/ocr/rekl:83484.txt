Dear Miss Morgan:

I want to finish the theatre because it is so much used.

It is naturally dismal in an unfinished condition.  I do not think it would take a great 
lot of money or work to put it in a comfortable state.

I have the following reflections  regarding it:

1.  That tapestries would be rather ineffective on the walls unless we had a series of 
tapestries.

2. That whether we have tapestries or not, we ought to have asbestos board covering the 
walls and the tapestries hung on that in case we use tapestries.

In case we do not use tapestries, we could use the asbestos board and have it painted by 
some magazine artist like Adorente, who would give us some really good work at a not too
 high expense.

The third  alternative is to use Byne's velvet over the asbestos board.  That might be 
the best for acoustics, but it is a little bit expensive.

Regarding the ceiling, we probably have a real ceiling that would fit.  But do you think
 a real ceiling would be dangerous in case of fire?  Should we merely paint the concrete 
 beams to look like a real ceiling?

I think it would be better to paint the concrete beams, or if necessary to cover them 
with asbestos board and paint the board.

The theatre must be practicable from an acoustic point of view, and I do not see why it
 cannot be beautiful too.

The seats should be comfortable arm-chair seats, and I do not see why the floor should
 not have carpet.

This should improve the acoustic qualities and make the place seem warm and cozy.

Finally, what is the plan for heating?  The theatre is naturally very cold at present-- 
almost as cold as out-doors.  It should be well heated, so that people can sit in it 
even in evening dress and be comfortable.

Sincerely,

s/ W.R. Hearst
